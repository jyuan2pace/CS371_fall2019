it
that
the
arms
were
scraping
some
of
the
sequins
off
his
suit
Looking
down
he
noticed
that
sequins
had
been
falling
off
his
suit
all
along
leaving
a
sparkly
trail
as
he
walked
Oh
great
he
thought
Now
on
top
of
everything
else
my
suit
is
shedding
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
I
guess
it
must
be
just
about
time
for
the
Eggplant
Uprising
he
commented
The
what
Ernie
was
confused
as
usual
Oh
come
on
The
Captain
was
annoyed
Don
t
you
pay
attention
to
anything
I
tell
you
You
know
the
Revolt
of
the
Vegetables
the
Purple
Menace
remember
when
they
nuked
us
back
to
the
Stone
Age
Oh
sure
Ernie
remembered
being
nuked
well
enough
He
had
some
vague
recollection
of
the
other
stuff
too
He
decided
to
pretend
he
remembered
the
rest
of
it
as
well
since
he
was
tired
of
being
picked
on
for
not
paying
attention
So
uh
what
about
it
Well
anyway
the
Captain
went
on
After
the
Great
Traffic
Jam
The
what
Ernie
broke
in
involuntarily
Oh
you
re
right
said
the
Captain
slightly
abashed
I
didn
t
tell
you
about
that
The
Great
Traffic
Jam
took
place
because
of
this
problem
they
had
due
to
chronic
over
production
of
cars
You
see
they
just
kept
building
all
these
cars
and
people
kept
buying
them
just
for
the
heck
of
it
even
though
they
didn
t
have
anyplace
to
go
in
them
Well
of
course
it
had
to
happen
one
particularly
nice
summer
day
everybody
decided
to
go
for
a
drive
all
at
the
same
time
They
wound
up
bumper
to
bumper
coast
to
coast
The
entire
country
was
tied
up
in
total
gridlock
People
didn
t
know
what
to
do
they
didn
t
know
how
to
get
around
without
their
cars
anymore
It
was
terrible
there
was
mass
starvation
Thousands
died
vultures
picked
their
bones
through
their
convertible
tops
Well
I
m
sure
you
can
see
that
under
circumstances
like
these
people
were
in
no
mood
for
a
practical
joke
Uh
right
Ernie
thought
he
d
just
agree
and
maybe
the
Captain
would
go
on
with
the
story
without
noticing
that
Ernie
wasn
t
following
the
story
at
all
Ernie
was
lucky
The
Captain
continued
Well
you
can
imagine
how
people
felt
when
rumors
began
to
fly
about
certain
species
of
giant
plants
that
had
escaped
from
the
atomic
testing
laboratories
and
had
grown
to
enormous
size
by
feasting
on
human
flesh
And
how
these
plants
were
determined
to
get
revenge
on
the
entire
animal
kingdom
for
the
millions
of
years
of
abuse
they
and
their
plant
brothers
had
had
to
put
up
with
at
the
hands
and
paws
and
muzzles
and
so
on
of
non
vegetable
life
forms
Ernie
furled
his
brow
Does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Vegetable
Rights
Movement
You
got
it
agreed
Captain
Memory
Ernie
felt
a
sinking
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
In
spite
of
himself
he
WAS
beginning
to
remember
all
this
He
didn
t
WANT
to
remember
it
because
if
he
remembered
it
that
meant
Ernie
didn
t
want
to
think
about
what
that
meant
Anyway
the
Captain
continued
They
were
going
to
organize
all
the
vegetables
stage
a
massive
uprising
and
eliminate
all
animal
life
for
ever
On
top
of
all
this
these
plants
were
invulnerable
to
conventional
weapons
and
could
only
be
destroyed
by
the
atomic
fires
that
had
created
them
Small
wonder
then
that
general
panic
broke
out
when
something
very
large
and
very
purple
raised
it
s
leafy
head
over
the
city
of
Chicago
Captain
Memory
chuckled
Oh
wow
said
Ernie
This
was
really
creepy
It
was
a
lot
like
telling
ghost
stories
around
the
campfire
at
camp
So
it
was
a
giant
man
eating
eggplant
Don
t
be
silly
How
could
there
be
a
such
a
thing
as
a
giant
man
eating
eggplant
Captain
Memory
was
amused
No
it
was
just
practical
joke
It
was
that
zany
Andreas
Labyrinth
and
his
band
of
merry
pranksters
up
to
their
little
games
again
Captain
Memory
chortled
I
still
remember
that
phony
Russian
invasion
That
was
really
a
riot
Or
how
about
that
bogus
epidemic
That
had
everybody
in
stitches
Something
about
that
explanation
didn
t
seem
quite
right
to
Ernie
but
he
wasn
t
in
the
mood
to
try
to
figure
out
what
it
was
He
wanted
to
hear
the
rest
of
Captain
Memory
s
story
So
then
what
happened
uh
will
happen
uh
so
what
about
the
Eggplant
Well
as
I
was
saying
Captain
Memory
always
enjoyed
telling
stories
It
wasn
t
really
a
giant
Eggplant
it
was
really
just
a
big
purple
balloon
But
it
looked
a
lot
like
a
giant
eggplant
you
know
big
scary
face
painted
on
it
and
all
I
suppose
in
saner
times
people
might
have
questioned
the
whole
thing
a
little
more
closely
After
all
there
wasn
t
really
any
proof
that
it
was
a
giant
eggplant
It
could
have
been
a
giant
grape
No
reason
to
nuke
a
giant
grape
is
there
I
guess
not
Ernie
supposed
he
might
as
well
agree
since
he
couldn
t
think
of
any
reason
on
Earth
to
nuke
a
giant
grape
But
people
just
didn
t
stop
and
think
the
Captain
went
on
They
just
went
ahead
and
dropped
the
bomb
And
when
they
found
out
boy
were
they
mad
Captain
Memory
chuckled
Of
course
it
isn
t
really
funny
if
it
doesn
t
make
somebody
mad
is
it
That
s
what
practical
jokes
are
all
about
Captain
Memory
paused
But
anyway
all
of
this
should
be
taking
place
just
about
he
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
Now
A
sound
like
that
of
distant
thunder
shook
the
house
Ernie
looked
out
the
window
Chicago
he
asked
Yup
answered
the
Captain
There
it
goes
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Did
they
nuke
Chicago
twice
Why
would
they
want
to
do
something
like
that
Captain
Memory
wondered
Once
you
nuke
it
it
stays
nuked
Well
in
that
case
Ernie
pondered
How
could
we
be
in
Chicago
just
before
it
got
nuked
before
when
we
re
here
just
before
it
got
nuked
now
Captain
Memory
frowned
That
is
confusing
isn
t
it
I
ve
never
quite
figured
that
out
The
Captain
didn
t
seem
overly
upset
about
the
problem
Ernie
decided
that
it
probably
wouldn
t
be
good
for
him
to
think
about
that
problem
anymore
He
decided
to
think
about
something
else
So
what
ever
happened
to
that
practical
joker
that
Andreas
Whats
His
Name
he
asked
As
if
in
answer
to
this
question
a
figure
burst
through
the
door
It
was
an
older
man
with
a
wild
white
beard
and
hair
His
clothes
were
in
tatters
and
he
was
covered
with
splotches
of
egg
rotten
tomatoes
and
other
things
too
disgusting
to
think
about
Hide
me
hide
me
he
implored
They
re
after
me
They
ll
tear
me
to
pieces
It
was
just
a
joke
I
didn
t
know
they
d
take
it
seriously
It
was
just
a
practical
joke
Well
Ernie
began
Suddenly
the
man
seemed
to
see
Ernie
clearly
for
the
first
time
A
BULLFIGHTER
He
looked
at
Captain
Memory
A
comic
book
character
He
looked
at
the
Fly
A
GIANT
FLY
What
IS
your
problem
Sterno
demanded
A
TALKING
DOG
the
man
shrieked
You
re
all
worse
than
me
I
ve
got
to
get
out
of
here
They
ll
tear
you
all
to
pieces
With
that
the
man
threw
himself
through
the
nearest
window
which
luckily
had
been
glazed
with
large
panes
of
sugar
instead
of
glass
He
sprinted
towards
a
group
of
trees
behind
the
house
and
disappeared
into
a
large
hole
beneath
one
of
them
Ernie
thought
he
saw
a
large
white
rabbit
with
a
watch
disappear
into
the
hole
as
well
but
he
wasn
t
sure
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
I
d
really
like
to
get
a
watch
he
commented
It
doesn
t
have
to
be
anything
fancy
A
Timex
would
be
okay
The
Fly
was
looking
out
the
door
Uh
oh
he
said
ominously
Here
they
come
Here
WHO
comes
Ernie
demanded
anxiously
The
angry
villagers
the
Fly
said
unhappily
You
know
with
the
torches
and
the
rocks
and
everything
You
don
t
want
to
mess
with
the
angry
villagers
man
They
re
mean
They
Fly
shuddered
He
seemed
to
have
had
some
kind
of
bad
experience
with
them
in
the
past
Uh
maybe
we
ought
to
get
out
of
here
Ernie
suggested
I
haven
t
finished
my
strawberry
mousse
Sterno
said
petulantly
Oh
man
I
don
t
know
what
we
re
gonna
do
said
the
Fly
miserably
They
re
closing
in
on
us
from
all
sides
Ernie
peered
through
the
broken
window
He
could
see
the
smoke
from
their
torches
in
the
distance
It
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
they
should
barricade
the
door
or
something
Unfortunately
the
door
had
already
been
broken
off
its
hinges
by
the
Nazis
Ernie
put
it
upright
in
the
doorframe
as
best
he
could
and
shoved
a
small
rocking
chair
up
against
it
to
hold
it
I
don
t
think
that
s
gonna
stop
anybody
the
Fly
said
glumly
Ernie
could
hear
angry
shouts
The
villagers
were
approaching
fast
I
think
we
better
do
something
Ernie
urged
Captain
Memory
Oh
yeah
Captain
Memory
looked
up
unconcernedly
Like
what
With
a
crash
a
rock
came
sailing
through
on
of
the
unbroken
windows
The
angry
shouts
were
quite
close
now
Ernie
couldn
t
understand
them
though
They
seemed
to
be
in
German
A
burning
torch
came
sailing
through
an
open
window
Another
landed
just
outside
the
door
Thick
black
smoke
began
to
fill
the
air
Ew
burning
sugar
complained
Sterno
How
rank
The
Fly
peeked
out
a
window
Oh
man
those
angry
villagers
They
re
bad
news
Hey
this
place
is
burning
up
Ernie
urged
Captain
Memory
We
ve
got
to
DO
something
Captain
Memory
made
a
wry
face
Well
I
guess
there
s
no
point
in
hanging
around
HERE
anymore
He
thought
a
moment
Let
s
try
F
D
The
scene
vanished
Blinking
Ernie
found
himself
once
again
in
an
entirely
different
place
He
staggered
and
his
stomach
flip
flopped
Oh
man
he
moaned
I
don
t
know
if
I
can
take
these
sudden
changes
of
scene
anymore
Oh
Captain
Memory
seemed
surprised
Would
you
rather
be
back
at
the
gingerbread
cottage
Ernie
straightened
up
abruptly
No
no
that
s
okay
I
m
fine
just
fine
I
d
just
as
soon
be
right
um
He
looked
around
Captain
Memory
the
Fly
and
Sterno
were
all
looking
around
as
well
They
were
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
large
government
office
It
was
a
big
room
with
a
high
arched
ceiling
lit
by
rows
of
fluorescent
lights
The
walls
were
painted
eye
saver
green
It
looks
like
an
old
fashioned
post
office
or
something
Ernie
thought
In
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
long
row
of
tables
with
forms
in
little
pigeonholes
and
pens
attached
by
chains
A
row
of
windows
occupied
one
wall
each
with
a
bored
looking
clerk
doing
something
with
papers
A
sign
above
the
windows
said
Federal
Bureau
of
Drawers
Ernie
was
puzzled
Why
did
you
bring
us
here
He
asked
Captain
Memory
This
isn
t
quite
what
I
expected
admitted
the
Captain
He
seemed
just
as
puzzled
as
Ernie
Actually
I
didn
t
really
want
to
leave
I
really
wanted
to
have
another
piece
of
cake
German
chocolate
as
a
matter
of
fact
He
sighed
I
guess
I
won
t
get
my
cake
now
Ernie
sighed
as
well
He
wished
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
eat
something
while
they
were
still
at
the
cottage
He
was
beginning
to
get
really
hungry
and
it
didn
t
look
like
he
was
going
to
be
able
to
find
anything
to
eat
here
Ernie
looked
around
What
is
this
place
The
Captain
regarded
the
building
thoughfully
I
m
not
sure
but
I
think
it
s
a
database
A
database
Ernie
was
confused
I
thought
data
in
Cyberspace
was
supposed
to
look
like
big
glowing
geometric
forms
that
you
could
fly
around
in
Yeah
well
you
could
do
that
if
you
wanted
the
Captain
explained
But
businesses
usually
don
t
They
secretaries
don
t
like
em
They
like
something
a
little
more
you
know
traditional
Like
this
He
gestured
at
the
building
around
them
Their
discussion
was
interrupted
by
a
shrill
nasal
voice
Next
please
Ernie
looked
around
confusedly
That
s
you
An
unpleasant
looking
older
woman
with
her
hair
pulled
back
in
a
tight
bun
seemed
to
be
pointing
at
him
Step
up
to
the
window
please
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
What
should
we
do
The
Captain
shrugged
I
guess
we
should
step
up
to
the
window
They
did
so
Hello
Captain
Memory
said
pleasantly
to
the
woman
behind
the
window
Can
you
tell
us
why
we
re
here
Certainly
she
said
through
tight
lips
Captain
Memory
smiled
See
he
said
to
Ernie
This
isn
t
going
to
be
hard
at
all
The
woman
behind
the
window
smirked
unpleasantly
Just
fill
out
this
form
She
handed
a
thick
sheaf
of
papers
to
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
s
face
fell
What
s
this
for
The
woman
smirked
happily
That
s
a
form
Request
for
Information
I
assume
you
have
your
authorized
Form
with
you
Uh
I
don
t
think
so
the
Captain
answered
confusedly
What
is
it
Oh
you
must
have
your
Form
Request
for
Request
for
Information
completely
filled
out
authorized
and
validated
before
we
can
process
your
Form
Request
for
Information
Oh
you
don
t
have
a
Form
Here
you
are
The
woman
handed
Captain
Memory
another
thick
sheaf
of
papers
Captain
Memory
looked
very
unhappy
He
leafed
though
the
forms
These
are
real
long
he
complained
Be
sure
to
read
ALL
the
directions
the
woman
simpered
cheerfully
Her
mood
seemed
to
be
improving
with
every
passing
form
And
fill
in
all
the
blanks
except
those
marked
Do
Not
Fill
In
This
Blank
Of
course
if
you
fail
to
fill
in
any
of
the
correct
blanks
or
if
you
should
happen
to
fill
in
any
blank
marked
Do
Not
Fill
In
This
Blank
then
you
ll
have
to
start
ALL
over
again
She
cackled
with
glee
at
the
thought
And
of
course
you
ll
need
a
Form
Request
for
Authorization
of
Forms
a
Form
Request
for
Validation
of
Forms
a
Form
b
Request
for
Instructions
for
Authorization
and
Validation
of
Forms
and
a
Form
A
Application
for
Verification
of
Authorization
and
Validation
She
handed
Captain
Memory
four
more
thick
forms
He
now
had
a
pile
of
forms
about
eight
inches
high
in
front
of
him
And
of
course
she
said
to
Ernie
We
ll
need
a
complete
set
of
forms
from
you
as
well
she
handed
Ernie
a
similar
stack
of
papers
And
from
you
and
from
you
She
handed
the
Fly
and
Sterno
each
their
own
stack
The
woman
seemed
positively
ecstatic
now
Ernie
looked
at
the
pile
in
shock
There
s
there
s
thousands
of
them
Oh
yes
said
the
woman
gleefully
There
used
to
be
only
hundreds
but
ever
since
they
passed
the
Paperwork
Reduction
Act
we
ve
had
far
more
Ernie
regarded
the
papers
with
dismay
After
you
ve
filled
all
those
out
the
woman
continued
delightedly
We
ll
start
on
the
rest
The
foursome
took
their
piles
of
forms
to
the
tables
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
began
leafing
through
them
despondently
These
government
offices
are
always
so
depressing
Sterno
complained
Why
must
they
always
paint
them
that
ghastly
shade
of
green
Ernie
decided
that
he
agreed
with
Sterno
but
he
was
too
depressed
to
talk
He
began
leafing
listlessly
through
his
Form
Application
for
Verification
of
Authorization
and
Validation
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
happened
to
be
at
the
top
of
the
pile
It
started
out
straightforwardly
enough
Name
Social
Security
Father
s
Name
Mother
s
Name
Mother
s
Maiden
Name
DO
NOT
WRITE
IN
THIS
SPACE
Grandfather
s
Name
Grandmother
s
Name
Ernie
tried
to
fill
in
his
name
but
the
pen
on
the
little
chain
wouldn
t
write
Instead
he
flipped

Ernie
looked
up
Do
you
get
the
feeling
they
re
playing
games
with
us
he
asked
the
others
Oh
NO
cried
the
Fly
desperately
What
said
Ernie
alarmed
I
wrote
in
the

that
says
Do

wailed
the
Fly
Tsk
tsk
said
Sterno
You
re
in
big
trouble
now
Ernie
was
glad
that
it
was
someone
other
than
himself
who
was
in
big
trouble
for
a
change
He
looked
over
at
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
was
having
a
hard
time
filling
out
his
forms
He
seemed
to
have
gotten
stuck
Ernie
looked
over
his
shoulder
As
a
matter
of
fact
the
Captain
seemed
to
have
gotten
stuck
on
the
first
space
NAME
Should
I
put
Captain
Memory

Captain
he
mused
Ernie
noticed
that
the

was
different
from
his
Ernie
read

I

said
Captain
Memory
I
can
put
Memory
under
Name
and
Captain
under
Rank
I
wonder
what
I
should
put
under
Cereal
Number
Ernie
suddenly
became
very
uneasy
I
think
maybe
we
should
just
get
out
of
here
while
we
have
the
chance
Sterno
was
leafing
through
his
pile
of
papers
Aha
he
cried
Here
we
go
Form
Request
for
Authorization
to
Apply
for
a
License
to
Purchase
Cigars
Now
we
re
getting
somewhere
Sterno
did
not
find
the
forms
upsetting
at
all
In
fact
he
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
able
to
deal
with
them
He
began
scribbling
industriously
in
the
blanks
As
Ernie
watched
he
took
his
sheaf
of
forms
to
one
of
the
windows
where
it
was
stamped
He
then
took
it
to
another
window
where
a
large
gold
seal
was
affixed
to
it
Then
on
to
another
window
where
several
people
signed
it
He
then
disappeared
around
a
corner
and
returned
moments
later
carrying
a
large
box
of
cigars
Wow
The
Fly
was
awestruck
That
s
amazing
I
wonder
how
he
does
that
It
s
not
really
that
difficult
commented
Sterno
lighting
up
a
big
cigar
His
disposition
always
improved
tremendously
when
he
had
a
cigar
I
ll
tell
you
a
secret
the
universe
is
actually
a
giant
bureaucracy
It
s
possible
to
get
anything
in
the
Cosmos
done
if
you
fill
out
the
right
forms
However
filling
out
the
right
forms
can
sometimes
be
very
difficult
indeed
He
puffed
his
cigar
appreciatively
Havanas
no
less
One
needs
a
special
permit
to
get
these
I
ll
have
you
know
The
Fly
meanwhile
was
intent
on
trying
to
erase
what
he
had
written
in
the
space
marked
Do
Not
Write
in
This
Space
So
far
he
had
only
succeeded
in
tearing
a
hole
in
the
paper
Ernie
meanwhile
was
noticing
the
fact
that
all
the
clerks
and
tellers
seemed
to
be
watching
them
Another
unusual
thing
struck
him
Hey
guys
he
commented
Did
you
notice
that
there
s
all
these
clerks
and
all
these
officials
but
no
customers
besides
us
Egad
that
IS
odd
agreed
Sterno
Everyone
knows
that
the
usual
ratio
is
customers
per
clerk
He
looked
around
Where
ARE
all
the
lines
I
ve
never
seen
a
government
office
this
empty
except
of
course
at
the
Administration
for
Not
Doing
Anything
At
All
Building
and
even
there
only
after
P
M
on
weekends
It
does
seem
suspicious
Ernie
was
thrilled
that
for
once
someone
agreed
with
him
Okay
well
that
proves
it
right
So
let
s
get
out
of
here
okay
I
ve
got
it
cried
Captain
Memory
He
grabbed
a
pen
and
wrote
in
large
childlike
block
letters
in
the
space
marked
Serial
Number
FROSTED
FLAKES
There
he
said
beaming
He
looked
at
the
next
line
and
his
face
fell
Oh
it
s
an
essay
question
I
hate
essay
questions
So
let
s
get
out
of
here
okay
Ernie
urged
He
felt
more
uneasy
with
each
passing
moment
Captain
Memory
sighed
I
guess
we
might
as
well
I
m
never
gonna
finish
this
thing
He
pushed
the
pile
of
papers
aside
Ernie
began
slowly
heading
toward
the
door
acutely
aware
of
all
the
clerks
watching
him
He
tried
to
act
as
nonchalant
as
possible
whistling
a
little
tune
and
shuffling
his
feet
as
he
walked
Just
a
minute
he
heard
the
old
woman
clerk
cry
out
Just
WHERE
do
you
think
you
re
going
Uh
uh
Ernie
stammered
Don
t
you
know
you
re
not
allowed
to
leave
without
filling
out
a
Form
Application
for
Authorization
to
Apply
for
Permission
for
an
Interruption
in
Completion
of
Forms
she
shrieked
Get
back
here
Ernie
thought
fast
Uh
I
gotta
go
to
the
bathroom
The
old
woman
glared
at
the
other
three
And
what
about
YOU
The
others
followed
Ernie
s
lead
Uh
we
all
gotta
go
to
the
bathroom
they
chorused
in
unison
The
clerk
scowled
All
right
Fill
out
this
Form
Request
for
Permission
to
Apply
for
Authorization
for
Admission
to
the
Sanitary
Facility
she
snapped
Anyway
you
re
going
the
wrong
way
The
bathroom
s
that
way
She
pointed
down
a
long
corridor
which
seemed
to
disappear
into
the
bowels
of
the
building
Ernie
looked
at
the
others
RUN
he
yelled
They
all
sprinted
for
the
door
Stop
them
shrieked
the
old
woman
but
they
were
already
through
the
door
Outside
they
found
themselves
on
the
dingy
streets
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
large
city
greatly
in
need
of
urban
renewal
We
d
better
keep
moving
Ernie
urged
They
re
right
behind
us
The
Fly
looked
back
No
they
re
not
Ernie
stopped
confused
and
turned
around
Sure
enough
there
was
no
sign
of
pursuit
Why
aren
t
they
chasing
us
Ernie
wondered
Oh
here
s
the
reason
said
Captain
Memory
regarding
his
bare
wrist
It
s
five
o
clock
Civil
servants
never
work
past
five
He
continued
to
regard
his
bare
wrist
I
d
really
like
to
get
a
watch
Ernie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
So
we
re
safe
then
At
least
till
nine
o
clock
tomorrow
morning
Captain
Memory
agreed
He
looked
around
brightly
Let
s
go
for
a
walk
Maybe
we
can
find
a
jewelry
store
somewhere
around
here
Captain
Memory
paused
reflectively
looking
at
his
bare
wrist
It
doesn
t
have
to
be
a
Rolex
A
Seiko
would
be
okay
Of
course
I
wouldn
t
mind
a
Rolex
They
began
strolling
down
the
street
As
they
neared
the
corner
they
began
to
hear
music
in
the
distance
Ernie
recognized
the
sound
of
steel
drums
and
guitars
Reggae
he
said
Somebody
s
playing
reggae
music
around
here
Ernie
relaxed
While
he
wasn
t
a
particular
fan
of
reggae
music
it
made
him
fell
more
at
home
to
come
across
anything
at
all
he
could
recognize
As
they
turned
the
corner
they
came
upon
a
group
of
black
people
who
seemed
to
be
having
a
party
They
wore
bright
colored
clothes
and
had
their
hair
hanging
down
in
long
braids
Dreadlocks
Ernie
recognized
They
must
be
Rastafarians
The
Fly
seemed
totally
confused
by
these
people
Hey
guy
he
said
to
one
of
them
Uh
do
you
live
around
here
Oh
no
mon
the
man
answered
in
a
thick
Jamaican
accent
We
not
from
here
mon
We
from
de
Islands
We
Rastas
In
spite
of
himself
Ernie
found
himself
becoming
suspicious
For
one
thing
they
didn
t
look
like
other
black
people
Ernie
knew
There
was
something
funny
about
their
skin
tone
It
was
unusually
black
and
it
seemed
to
be
coming
off
on
objects
around
them
Out
of
a
corner
of
his
eye
Ernie
noticed
a
trash
can
nearby
It
seemed
to
be
full
of
empty
bottles
of
black
shoe
polish
Another
of
the
Rastafarians
approached
the
Fly
Hey
brother
he
said
pointing
at
the
Fly
s
antenna
You
got
de
dreadlocks
too
I
see
Here
smoke
some
of
dis
ganja
He
handed
the
Fly
a
funny
looking
cigarette
Uh
thanks
The
Fly
accepted
the
cigarette
However
he
couldn
t
seem
to
fit
it
into
his
snout
no
matter
which
way
he
held
it
Ernie
heard
the
reassuring
strains
of
Bob
Marley
and
the
Wailers
drifting
out
through
a
nearby
doorway
but
he
was
unable
to
shake
his
suspicions
He
noticed
something
unusual
about
the
man
s
footwear
Since
when
do
Rastas
wear
jackboots
The
man
seemed
momentarily
nonplussed
but
quickly
recovered
his
composure
Oh
sure
mon
We
all
wear
de
jackboots
now
It
s
de
new
in
thing
He
turned
to
the
Fly
Ain
t
dat
right
brother
The
Fly
had
managed
to
get
a
grip
on
the
cigarette
with
his
snout
and
was
puffing
away
He
started
to
giggle
Jackboots
Sure
Why
not
Dere
you
go
mon
the
Rasta
said
reassuringly
while
taking
out
a
monocle
and
fitting
it
into
his
eye
You
got
nothin
to
worry
about
We
just
Rastas
mon
We
not
Nazis
or
nothin
He
laughed
Oh
no
The
Fly
was
giggling
uncontrollably
now
Hey
that
s
GREAT
music
he
said
enthusiastically
You
guys
are
really
alright
This
is
FUN
He
broke
down
into
fits
of
hysterical
giggling
Take
it
easy
mon
the
Rasta
said
to
Ernie
My
name
s
Jack
I
from
Monterey
Dey
call
me
Monterey
Jack
Sterno
stiffened
Monterey
Jack
Do
you
know
what
that
is
he
hissed
It
s
it
s
CHEESE
The
Rasta
stood
abruptly
up
the
monocle
dropping
out
of
his
eye
SEIZE
THEM
he
shrieked
his
Islands
accent
abruptly
vanishing
RUN
shouted
Ernie
and
Sterno
together
Hey
guys
what
s
the
rush
asked
the
Fly
his
head
lolling
from
side
to
side
Isn
t
this
a
FUN
party
Come
ON
Ernie
grabbed
the
Fly
s
tie
and
pulled
him
along
like
a
puppy
on
a
leash
The
ran
down
the
narrow
street
the
Fly
stumbling
and
giggling
Close
behind
them
were
the
imitation
Rastas
discarding
their
Caribbean
clothes
as
they
ran
to
reveal
Nazi
uniforms
beneath
Quick
in
here
Ernie
pulled
the
Fly
into
an
open
doorway
followed
by
Sterno
and
Captain
Memory
Inside
was
a
flight
of
stairs
They
ran
up
the
stairs
and
through
a
door
at
the
first
landing
to
find
themselves
in
a
long
corridor
lined
by
rows
of
doors
Looks
like
an
apartment
building
or
maybe
a
hotel
Ernie
observed
Maybe
we
can
find
a
room
to
hide
in
Good
idea
Sterno
agreed
I
d
like
a
room
with
a
TV
if
you
don
t
mind
Captain
Memory
added
Ernie
glared
at
him
and
hurried
down
the
hall
still
dragging
the
Fly
by
the
necktie
An
open
door
beckoned
The
four
rushed
into
what
appeared
to
be
an
ordinary
somewhat
run
down
hotel
room
slammed
the
door
behind
them
and
locked
it
Whew
Ernie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Well
I
don
t
think
they
can
find
us
in
here
Look
s
like
we
re
safe
The
Fly
collapsed
into
an
overstuffed
chair
He
held
his
hands
up
in
front
of
his
face
Oh
wow
he
said
wonderingly
Did
you
ever
look
at
your
hands
I
mean
really
LOOK
at
them
He
started
giggling
again
Hmmph
Sterno
sniffed
Some
people
just
can
t
hold
their
ganja
There
was
a
knock
on
the
door
Ssh
Ernie
cautioned
the
others
Let
s
just
be
quiet
and
they
won
t
know
we
re
in
here
Ve
know
you
re
in
dere
a
voice
outside
the
door
shouted
Ernie
was
astonished
How
could
they
know
we
were
in
here
he
whispered
to
the
others
Dat
s
easy
answered
the
voice
from
behind
them
door
Ve
just
follow
ze
trail
of
sequins
Ernie
looked
at
his
toreador
suit
Large
sparkle
less
patches
confirmed
his
worst
fears
Sure
enough
a
faint
but
clearly
identifiable
trail
of
sequins
led
under
the
door
Ernie
became
aware
of
everyone
glaring
at
him
except
of
course
the
Fly
who
was
still
busily
examining
his
hands
You
again
snarled
Sterno
Well
hey
Ernie
shrugged
defensively
What
am
I
supposed
to
do
you
know
I
The
knock
sounded
again
this
time
louder
Open
up
Ernie
looked
at
the
door
I
ll
be
cool
about
this
he
decided
Maybe
I
can
fake
them
out
Uh
yes
he
called
out
brightly
Who
s
there
Nazis
came
the
reply
Open
up
Uh
no
thanks
We
don
t
want
any
You
vill
open
zis
door
NOW
Ernie
thought
fast
Uh
I
m
in
the
bathroom
right
now
Could
you
come
back
later
BREAK
DOWN
ZE
DOOR
Something
large
and
heavy
thudded
into
the
door
Ernie
looked
around
the
room
frantically
The
fire
escape
Ernie
pointed
through
an
open
window
Quick
Everybody
Out
that
way
The
ran
to
the
window
and
climbed
down
the
fire
escape
Ernie
pulling
the
Fly
by
the
necktie
Hey
what
s
the
rush
guys
asked
the
Fly
giggling
We
just
got
here
As
they
hurried
down
the
fire
escape
Ernie
heard
the
sound
of
the
door
breaking
down
behind
them
After
zem
a
voice
cried
The
bottom
of
the
fire
escape
led
to
a
narrow
alley
Hurrying
along
it
the
found
themselves
facing
a
large
iron
door
There
was
no
other
way
out
of
the
alley
The
sounds
of
pursuit
were
close
behind
them
Ernie
tried
the
doorknob
It
was
unlocked
Quick
through
here
he
shouted
They
four
scrambled
through
the
door
and
slammed
it
behind
them
Inside
it
was
totally
dark
Ernie
felt
along
the
doorframe
for
a
lock
He
found
one
and
locked
it
He
found
another
and
locked
that
too
There
was
also
a
large
bolt
and
a
huge
padlock
He
locked
those
as
well
There
he
said
That
should
keep
them
out
We
re
safe
now
He
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Where
are
we
he
heard
Captain
Memory
s
voice
ask
I
can
t
see
a
thing
Ernie
inched
carefully
forward
his
hands
outstretched
hoping
to
find
a
lamp
or
a
light
switch
or
something
Suddenly
from
out
of
the
darkness
a
voice
rang
out
Ah
how
nice
of
you
to
return
the
voice
said
Ve
haff
been
vaiting
for
you
Uh
oh
Ernie
began
I
think
we
re
in
trouble
guys
The
now
familiar
voice
of
the
game
show
announcer
boomed
out
You
sure
are
because
it
s
time
for
WHEEL
OF
TORTURE
There
was
the
sound
of
tremendous
applause
The
entire
scene
erupted
into
blinding
light
The
announcer
continued
And
now
for
our
first
contestant
from
Toledo
Ohio
it
s
Goombah
the
Toreador
My
name
s
Ernie
Ernie
complained
Gimme
a
break
huh
SURE
the
announcer
agreed
cheerfully
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
LIKE
BROKEN
Ernie
heard
uproarious
laughter
Say
the
announcer
continued
I
just
LOVE
your
suit
You
re
missing
a
few
sequins
though
Ernie
heard
laughter
again
this
time
cut
short
in
a
very
artificial
sounding
way
His
eyes
were
beginning
to
adjust
to
the
light
but
he
still
couldn
t
see
clearly
And
here
s
our
second
contestant
from
Des
Moines
Iowa
it
s
Seth
Brundage
the
Human
Fly
Aw
I
wish
you
wouldn
t
call
me
that
the
Fly
complained
It
makes
a
real
bad
impression
you
know
Couldn
t
you
just
call
me
Seth
Sure
thing
Mr
Fly
the
announcer
agreed
jovially
The
Fly
moaned
And
I
m
not
from
Des
Moines
either
Ernie
s
vision
was
beginning
to
clear
up
They
were
unfortunately
back
on
the
stage
of
Wheel
of
Torture
They
seemed
to
have
blundered
or
been
maneuvered
into
the
same
stage
they
had
escaped
from
twice
before
Ernie
just
hoped
they
would
be
able
to
escape
from
it
again
He
looked
out
towards
the
audience
There
was
no
audience
just
empty
chairs
Ernie
looked
around
There
were
no
guards
no
chorus
girls
In
fact
there
was
only
one
person
the
Gestapo
s
greatest
Sturmbannfuhrer
Dr
Heinz
von
Liederkranz
the
man
whose
name
sounds
like
cheese
Ernie
heard
thunderous
applause
Tank
you
tank
you
von
Liederkranz
bowed
in
the
direction
of
the
non
existent
audience
He
then
reached
out
and
shut
off
a
small
tape
recorder
The
applause
ended
abruptly
He
turned
on
another
small
tape
recorder
And
now
on
with
the
show
the
recorded
voice
of
the
announcer
rang
out
Von
Liederkranz
shut
that
one
off
too
Zo
ve
meet
again
Von
Liederkranz
smiled
unpleasantly
Now
you
are
in
my
power
You
vill
tell
me
vhat
I
vant
to
know
Ernie
looked
at
the
empty
chairs
What
happened
to
the
audience
Von
Liederkranz
s
face
turned
hard
Dat
vas
most
unfortunate
Dey
all
refused
to
confess
und
I
vas
forced
to
eliminate
dem
For
vhich
He
looked
around
quickly
Finding
no
one
else
around
him
he
settled
on
Ernie
YOU
vill
pay
schweinhund
he
cried
slapping
Ernie
with
his
riding
crop
Why
me
cried
Ernie
I
didn
t
SILENCE
Von
Liederkranz
eyed
them
all
suspiciously
Unfortunately
I
vill
not
be
able
to
interrogate
you
at
de
moment
due
to
a
um
temporary
staff
shortage
Until
zis
situation
can
be
remedied
I
vill
be
forced
to
keep
you
locked
up
Zis
time
however
you
vill
not
escape
due
to
ze
incompetence
of
guards
Ze
guards
have
been
liquidated
He
smiled
evilly
Now
you
vill
go
behind
Door
Nummer
One
MARSCH
He
gestured
at
them
with
an
evil
looking
weapon
The
foursome
found
themselves
herded
through
Door
Number
One
which
crashed
shut
behind
them
with
a
very
loud
and
ominous
clang
Ernie
looked
around
his
eyes
slowly
becoming
accustomed
to
the
darkness
They
seemed
to
be
back
in
the
same
large
dungeon
cell
they
had
been
held
in
before
The
room
was
dimly
lit
by
a
torch
attached
to
one
wall
The
far
reaches
of
the
room
disappeared
into
the
darkness
making
it
impossible
to
tell
exactly
how
big
the
cell
was
Oh
man
the
Fly
complained
Not
here
again
This
place
is
no
fun
I
waited
for
my
date
in
here
for
DAYS
man
She
never
showed
up
I
couldn
t
even
get
a
drink
while
I
waited
The
service
in
here
is
terrible
He
peered
into
the
darkness
Waiter
Waiter
He
sighed
It
doesn
t
do
any
good
Nobody
ever
comes
Ernie
peered
into
the
darkness
No
he
couldn
t
see
anything
that
even
remotely
resembled
a
waiter
However
straining
his
ears
he
did
seem
to
hear
something
It
sounded
like
sniffling
and
perhaps
crying
Who
s
there
he
called
into
the
darkness
Two
small
figures
began
to
approach
into
the
light
As
they
approached
Ernie
could
see
that
they
were
children
a
little
boy
and
a
little
girl
They
were
both
dressed
in
German
national
costumes
The
girl
was
wearing
a
dirndl
and
the
boy
was
wearing
lederhosen
and
a
little
alpine
hat
They
both
seemed
very
sad
Ernie
was
surprised
Hi
there
he
said
to
the
little
boy
in
a
kindly
manner
What
s
your
name
My
name
is
Hansel
said
the
boy
with
a
heavy
German
accent
Und
dis
is
my
sister
Gretel
The
Fly
regarded
the
children
Say
you
kids
haven
t
seen
my
date
have
you
She
s
about
five
foot
two
eyes
of
blue
The
children
looked
at
him
uncomprehendingly
The
Fly
sighed
Oh
well
it
was
worth
a
try
Ernie
regarded
the
children
with
amazement
How
did
you
kids
get
here
Hansel
sniffled
sadly
Ve
vas

by
ze
Gestapo
he
explained
Ve

forest
und
ve
found

house
und

vicked
vitch
und

Hansel
sniffled
tearfully
How

Gestapo
agent
Gee

s
tough
kid
Ernie
said
sympathetically
He
hoped
Hansel
wouldn
t
cry
He
never
knew
what
to
do
around
crying
children
Well
cheer
up
kid
Captain
Memory
added
in
brightly
It
could
be
worse
How
asked
Hansel
innocently
Uh
Captain
Memory
thought
for
a
moment
I
ll
get
back
to
you
on
that
He
fell
silent
Hansel
whimpered
It
s
so
cold
and
dark
and
awful
in
here
I
m
afraid
Ernie
winced
Oh
he
s
gonna
start
crying
he
thought
What
am
I
gonna
do
I
don
t
know
what
to
do
when
kids

Ernie
tried
to
think
of
something
to
do
Uh
cheer
up
kid
Maybe
I
ll
tell
you
a
story
Hansel
brightened
Oh
do

know
a
good
story
Ernie
frowned
Uh

He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Hey

these
kids
a
story
You

of
stories
Tell
us
a
story
Tell

The
children
jumped
up
and
down
in
front
of
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
seemed
confused
Well

I
dunno
Oh

said
the
Fly
You

not
gonna
disappoint

poor
little
kids

Captain
Memory
hesitated
Well

Hansel
jumped
up
and
down
excitedly
Tell

Cyberspace
vithout

Ernie
frowned
How

Gretel

jumping
up
and
down
excitedly
Tell

how
you
can
JUMP

dat

not
supposed
to

any
external
commands
Tell

The
Captain
seemed
unsure
Well
I
don
t
know
if
I
should
talk
about
that
Oh

said
Hansel
reassuringly
You

tell

Dere

no

Ve

kids
You

the
Captain
began
Oh

Why

kids
who

story
We

kids
And
he
laughed
We

not
Gestapo
agents
Gretel
laughed
too
Oh
no
we
re
not
midget
Gestapo
agents
nothing
of
the

How
silly
to
even
think

a
thing
Hansel
gestured
at
Gretel
See
Dot

Und

Captain

a
sigh
of

Gut

Hansel
and
Gretel
beamed
Now

Captain
Memory
brightly
Uh
he
scratched
his
head
What

Hansel
fumed
Talk

Or

He
noticed
Gretel
glaring
at
him
He
caught
himself
Oh

He
laughed
feebly
You
vill
tell
us
how
you
JUMP
from
place
to
place
ja
Sterno
looked
at
the
children
suspiciously
There
s
something
very
peculiar
about
these
children
he
remarked
He
looked
them
up
and
down
carefully
You
children
he
demanded
What
is
your
LAST
NAME
Hansel
and
Gretel
looked
at
each
other
in
confusion
Our
what
You
last
name
Sterno
insisted
Your
first
names

Hansel
and
Gretel
what

last
names
Even
Germans

names
Hansel
and
Gretel
put
their
heads
together
and
began
whispering
furiously
between
them
Last

Finally

Sterno
stiffened

hissed
It

CHEESE

A
look
of
fury
passed
over
both
Hansel
and
Gretel
s
faces
Dummkopf
Gretel
screamed
at
Hansel

Und

Hansel
shrieked
back
It

You

Suddenly
the
door
to
the
dungeon
cell
flew
open
Von
Liederkranz
stood
in
the
doorway
framed
in
light
Zo
he
said
menacingly
My
liddle
subterfuge
does
not
fool
you
eh
Dot
is
most
unfortunate
Now
I
vill
have
to
interrogate
you
meinself
Out
The
entire
group
stepped
out
of
the
dungeon
cell
and
back
onto
the
stage
of
WHEEL
OF
TORTURE
Von
Liederkranz
turned
to
Hansel
and
Gretel
Und
as
for
YOU
They
winced
Such
incompetence
is
not
to
be
tolerated
You

The
midgets
blanched
NEIN

MARSCH
Von
Liederkranz
gestured
toward
the
door
with
his
evil
looking
weapon
The
midgets
filed
sadly
through
the
door
which
slammed
shut
behind
them
Ernie
heard
two
piercing
blood
curdling
screams
and
then
silence
Shaken
he
turned
to
Captain
Memory
What
what
is
behind
Door
Number
Four
The
Captain
shook
his
head
sadly
You
DON

Ernie
thought
for
a
moment
and
