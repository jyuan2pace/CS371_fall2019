the
sheep
They
re
asking
our
help
in
breaking
free
of
this
awful
tyranny
Wooly
Bully
that
reminds
me
of
something
Captain
Memory
became
thoughtful
The
Hully
Gully
perhaps
The
Fly
s
antennae
perked
up
The
Frug
The
Jerk
The
Mashed
Potato
he
suggested
The
Swim
Sterno
added
Or
even
The
TWIST
A
brilliant
idea
occurred
to
Ernie
I
know
This
must
be
The
Land
of
Dances
Sterno
turned
to
Ernie
with
a
look
of
utter
disgust
Look
we
ve
been
through
this
before
remember
Fondue
chocolate
watches
Heidi
remember
Ernie
became
subdued
You
re
trying
to
tell
me
this
is
Switzerland
right
The
Fly
s
antennae
twitched
excitedly
Oh
I
remember
that
now
Land
of
Dances
That
was
a
song
by
Cannibal
and
the
Headhunters
Cannibal
Ernie
started
He
thought
for
a
moment
On
the
other
hand
he
went
on
Switzerland
is
fine
Chocolate
Heidi
Fine
just
fine
Well
Sterno
sniffed
I
m
glad
THAT
S
settled
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
wrist
Watches
Did
you
say
watches
Ernie
looked
at
the
sheep
He
noticed
that
each
of
them
wore
rather
a
nice
Swiss
watch
on
one
of
their
front
forelegs
Captain
Memory
continued
to
look
at
his
bare
wrist
and
sighed
Oh
dear
I
m
afraid
it
s
getting
late
We
ll
have
to
be
going
Ernie
was
nonplussed
Aren
t
we
supposed
to
like
help
them
overthrow
the
evil
ruler
or
something
Captain
Memory
shrugged
It
s
not
my
problem
you
know
I
mean
we
can
t
do
everything
Baa
Baa
said
the
lead
sheep
insistently
The
sheep
wants
to
know
Sterno
translated
If
you
can
t
help
overthrow
the
Wooly
Bully
could
you
at
least
give
him
some
clue
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
his
daughter
She
s
been
missing
since
yesterday
and
he
s
afraid
something
terrible
might
have
happened
to
her
the
poor
little
lamb
Ernie
burped
Everyone
turned
to
look
at
him
Uh
who
me
I
don
t
know
anything
about
it
Why
would
I
know
anything
about
it
He
fidgeted
uncomfortably
compulsively
wiping
his
still
greasy
hands
on
his
fur
loincloth
Stop
looking
at
me
like
that
I
think
we
d
better
get
going
said
Captain
Memory
decisively
Now
The
four
turned
to
leave
Ernie
looked
back
at
the
group
of
sheep
He
smiled
weakly
trying
to
think
of
something
nice
to
say
in
Sheepish
Ba
he
waved
good
bye
The
lead
sheep
started
and
rose
up
on
his
hind
legs
looking
very
angry
and
offended
That
was
very
rude
Sterno
reproved
Ernie
Uh
what
did
I
say
asked
Ernie
bewildered
I
only
meant
After
ALL
Sterno
continued
You
ve
never
even
met
his
mother
And
even
if
you
had
I
seriously
doubt
she
would
have
consented
to
do
anything
like
that
with
YOU
Gee
I
m
sorry
I
Ernie
decided
that
perhaps
the
safest
thing
to
do
was
simply
be
quiet
The
four
continued
walking
Ernie
noticed
that
it
seemed
to
be
getting
warmer
Substantially
more
humid
too
Even
though
he
was
wearing
only
a
loincloth
Ernie
began
to
perspire
The
others
also
seemed
to
be
feeling
uncomfortable
from
the
heat
All
except
Captain
Memory
who
never
seemed
to
be
uncomfortable
at
all
As
the
sun
began
to
set
Ernie
noticed
that
the
vegetation
around
them
was
different
now
The
warm
area
they
were
heading
into
seemed
to
full
of
tropical
plants
Lush
flowers
and
tall
trees
loomed
ahead
of
them
In
fact
they
seemed
to
heading
into
a
jungle
Ernie
noticed
an
object
lying
in
the
grass
It
appeared
to
be
the
broken
remnants
of
a
vandalized
sign
of
some
sort
Ernie
could
just
barely
make
out
a
few
words
through
the
layers
of
graffiti
Pooda
something
Ernie
read
No
alcoholic
beverages
allowed
Do
not
feed
the
The
rest
was
gone
Something
about
it
made
Ernie
feel
very
uncomfortable
Um
is
it
really
a
good
idea
to
be
heading
into
the
jungle
at
night
Ernie
asked
nervously
Oh
you
re
right
said
Sterno
sarcastically
Let
s
just
check
into
a
Holiday
Inn
instead
Well
it
s
just
that
it
s
awfully
well
dark
Ernie
fidgeted
It
gets
that
way
at
night
Sterno
pointed
out
You
know
of
some
way
to
prevent
it
perhaps
Ernie
eyed
the
thick
jungle
vegetation
ahead
of
them
with
misgivings
What
if
there
s
um
hostile
natives
or
something
At
that
exact
moment
drums
began
pounding
in
the
distance
Ernie
began
to
feel
very
uneasy
Do
we
have
to
go
in
there
he
pleaded
No
not
at
all
Captain
Memory
pointed
out
We
can
just
stay
here
and
wait
for
the
Nazis
to
catch
up
with
us
if
you
like
Ernie
moaned
No
that
s
okay
Let
s
just
keep
going
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
I
dunno
nothing
seems
to
make
you
happy
You
don
t
want
to
go
you
don
t
want
to
stay
You
know
you
really
need
to
have
a
more
positive
attitude
Yeah
right
Ernie
grunted
They
continued
along
the
way
into
the
jungle
The
vegetation
seemed
to
swallow
them
up
The
heavy
masses
of
green
foliage
on
all
sides
seemed
to
offer
little
possibility
of
escape
The
continued
along
the
trail
which
became
ever
narrower
as
they
progressed
Look
the
Fly
pointed
ahead
It
was
now
almost
night
The
jungle
before
them
was
almost
pitch
black
However
off
to
the
left
small
points
of
light
could
be
seen
weaving
and
bobbing
in
and
out
of
the
foliage
in
the
distance
What
s
that
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Fireflies
Torches
the
Fly
corrected
It
s
those
villagers
we
saw
in
the
mountains
They
ve
come
to
meet
us
Isn
t
that
nice
Ernie
was
still
uneasy
Are
you
sure
they
re
friendly
villagers
The
Fly
peered
into
the
distance
They
sure
LOOK
friendly
It
looks
like
they
re
having
a
party
They
re
all
singing
and
dancing
As
the
villagers
approached
Ernie
began
to
be
able
to
make
out
what
they
were
singing
They
were
chanting
rhythmically
to
the
beat
of
the
drums
Na
na
na
na
na
na
na
na
na
Ernie
frowned
I
KNOW
that
song
It
s
um
it
s
Sure
the
Fly
broke
in
Land
of
Dances
What
a
great
song
AHA
cried
Ernie
See
I
told
you
I
was
right
He
turned
to
Sterno
See
This
is
The
Land
of
Dances
I
was
right
after
all
You
were
not
sniffed
Sterno
That
was
there
this
is
here
That
was
Switzerland
this
is
the
Land
of
Dances
Ernie
sulked
Well
I
was
sort
of
right
Anyway
this
is
The
Land
of
Dances
so
those
guys
with
the
torches
must
be
He
suddenly
turned
pale
CANNIBAL
AND
THE
HEADHUNTERS
Cool
agreed
the
Fly
Great
band
huh
What
are
we
gonna
DO
wailed
Ernie
Suddenly
they
were
distracted
by
a
loud
crashing
in
the
forest
behind
them
Gottverdammter
Schweinhund
The
crack
of
a
riding
crop
could
clearly
be
heard
They
turned
to
see
bright
fingers
of
white
light
as
though
from
high
powered
flashlights
probing
through
the
foliage
Zey
must
be
in
here
somevhere
they
heard
a
voice
call
out
Ze
trail
of
isotope
tracers
from
ze
radioactive
lamb
chops
leads
right
zis
vay
Ernie
pressed
his
hands
to
his
stomach
I
don
t
feel
good
he
moaned
Ernie
looked
up
to
find
the
other
three
glaring
at
him
How
was
I
to
know
the
lamb
chops
were
radioactive
he
protested
loudly
Do
you
think
I
would
have
eaten
them
if
I
knew
Ssh
The
four
heard
the
voice
behind
them
call
out
I
tink
I
hear
zem
Ernie
quickly
put
a
hand
over
his
mouth
Up
ahead
the
bobbing
torchlights
were
weaving
ever
closer
The
pounding
drums
and
chanting
was
getting
louder
The
chanting
had
changed
now
Oom
alla
Boom
Ernie
could
hear
Oom
alla
BOOM
From
behind
the
searchlights
were
weaving
ever
more
in
their
direction
slowly
beginning
to
focus
in
on
their
position
Ernie
whimpered
quietly
Hey
guys
look
at
this
the
Fly
pointed
to
something
in
the
darkness
Off
to
the
right
visible
only
to
the
Fly
s
huge
insect
eyes
a
faint
trail
split
off
from
the
main
path
Let
s
try
this
The
Fly
hurried
down
the
trail
The
others
followed
as
closely
as
possible
so
as
not
to
get
lost
in
the
increasing
darkness
The
four
scampered
along
the
dark
narrow
path
attempting
to
move
quickly
but
also
quietly
and
not
doing
a
very
good
job
of
either
The
sounds
of
pursuit
behind
them
seem
to
grow
ever
louder
The
trail
led
to
a
large
clearing
and
then
stopped
Surrounding
the
clearing
was
an
impenetrable
thicket
of
thorn
bushes
In
the
middle
of
the
clearing
was
a
large
iron
pot
big
enough
for
all
four
of
them
to
fit
into
at
the
same
time
It
sat
on
a
large
pile
of
neatly
arranged
firewood
A
heap
of
neatly
cut
up
potatoes
and
carrots
lay
nearby
I
don
t
like
the
looks
of
this
Ernie
moaned
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Can
t
you
get
us
out
of
here
he
pleaded
Captain
Memory
frowned
He
seemed
lost
in
thought
Well
I
suppose
it
s
worth
a
try
he
said
dubiously
With
that
he
turned
suddenly
and
slugged
Ernie
in
the
stomach
hard
Oof
Ernie
doubled
over
in
pain
Hey
what
BEEP
BEEP
BEEP
Ernie
was
astounded
at
the
sounds
coming
out
of
his
mouth
Good
Captain
Memory
cheered
It
still
works
Ernie
coughed
What
what
still
works
The
remote
Captain
Memory
seemed
particularly
cheerful
I
just
remembered
that
a
Franglian
remote
will
still
work
even
if
you
eat
it
Quality
construction
you
know
He
nodded
wisely
I
paid
a
little
extra
but
it
was
worth
it
The
Captain
regarded
Ernie
carefully
The
only
problem
is
it
s
a
little
hard
to
press
the
buttons
Let
me
see
Without
warning
he
elbowed
Ernie
violently
in
the
kidneys
Ernie
fell
to
the
ground
in
pain
He
opened
his
mouth
BEEP
BOOP
Captain
Memory
looked
embarrassed
Oh
sorry
Wrong
button
The
toe
of
his
boot
slammed
into
Ernie
s
ribs
BOOP
BEEP
There
we
go
Captain
Memory
exulted
Now
we
ve
got
it
Ernie
lay
in
the
dirt
moaning
Captain
Memory
reached
down
to
help
him
to
his
feet
Sorry
about
that
he
apologized
Still
you
have
to
expect
that
sort
of
thing
if
you
re
going
to
go
around
eating
remote
control
units
Ernie
staggered
to
his
feet
moaning
Look
the
Fly
pointed
up
into
the
sky
A
bright
object
seemed
to
be
descending
in
their
direction
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
Ah
here
he
comes
Right
on
time
The
Captain
looked
at
his
wrist
more
closely
Well
almost
on
time
As
the
bright
object
approached
Ernie
began
to
make
it
out
more
clearly
It
looked
like
well
it
looked
like
an
overly
large
Plymouth
taxi
It
had
huge
fins
two
tone
paint
and
rather
a
lot
of
rust
Captain
Memory
gestured
proudly
towards
it
as
it
came
in
for
a
landing
There
it
is
guys
he
announced
proudly
The
Luna
C
Ain
t
she
a
beauty
Sterno
glanced
behind
them
The
sounds
of
commotion
back
on
the
trail
were
increasing
Not
a
moment
too
soon
he
muttered
Ernie
watched
the
Luna
C
as
it
approached
for
a
landing
He
noticed
that
it
seemed
to
be
coming
in
rather
fast
With
a
deafening
crash
the
Luna
C
slammed
into
the
ground
throwing
a
cloud
of
dust
and
dirt
in
all
directions
As
the
dust
settled
Ernie
noticed
a
hubcap
rolling
listlessly
away
finally
coming
to
a
stop
by
a
nearby
tree
Captain
Memory
winced
but
then
quickly
regained
his
composure
He
started
towards
the
spacecraft
The
driver
s
side
door
of
the
Luna
C
opened
and
a
lanky
individual
with
long
unkempt
hair
got
out
He
was
wearing
a
loud
Hawaiian
shirt
and
dark
sunglasses
even
though
it
was
night
He
waved
at
Captain
Memory
Hey
dude
what
s
happenin
Hey
Ralph
Captain
Memory
waved
cheerily
at
the
driver
This
is
my
pilot
Ralph
he
introduced
the
man
to
the
group
as
they
all
sprinted
towards
the
spacecraft
Sterno
eyed
the
Luna
C
suspiciously
This
is
your
ship
That
s
it
Captain
Memory
waved
at
it
proudly
Then
how
come
it
says
Taxi
on
it
Sterno
asked
pointedly
Captain
Memory
s
face
fell
Well
well
I
was
supposed
to
get
a
limo
Well
they
told
me
I
could
have
a
limo
but
there
was
this
budget
problem
Anyway
I
could
ve
had
a
company
car
for
sure
except
um
there
was
that
problem
about
my
license
So
anyway
He
trailed
off
uncomfortably
So
you
hadda
take
a
cab
Sterno
finished
for
him
Well
well
Flustered
Captain
Memory
broke
off
Yeah
Ernie
noticed
that
the
sounds
behind
them
were
getting
awfully
close
Uh
could
we
talk
about
this
someplace
else
Captain
Memory
glanced
back
down
the
trail
You
re
right
He
turned
to
Ralph
Let
s
cruise
Ralph
looked
uncomfortable
Uh
I
wanted
to
tell
you
dude
We
got
a
little
problem
Let
s
talk
about
it
on
the
way
he
suggested
glancing
back
down
the
trail
The
guys
around
here
are
um
uncool
Ralph
nodded
understandingly
I
can
dig
it
He
got
into
the
driver
s
seat
while
the
other
four
piled
into
the
roomy
back
seat
Ralph
shifted
into
Fly
and
stomped
on
the
accelerator
The
Luna
C
instantly
shot
thirty
feet
straight
up
into
the
air
violently
flipped
upside
down
and
hung
there
unmoving
Ernie
Sterno
and
the
Fly
suddenly
found
themselves
upside
down
in
a
very
uncomfortable
position
laying
halfway
on
the
roof
and
halfway
in
their
seats
Captain
Memory
and
Ralph
however
were
sitting
quite
comfortably
in
their
seats
as
though
glued
into
them
So
like
I
was
saying
dude
Ralph
went
on
conversationally
We
got
this
little
problem
In
the
position
he
was
in
Ernie
could
see
the
ground
beneath
them
quite
clearly
through
the
Luna
C
s
large
rear
window
Their
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
commotion
taking
place
The
probing
searchlights
and
the
bobbing
torches
seemed
to
have
come
together
Ernie
heard
shouts
screams
machine
gun
fire
Then
all
was
silent
After
a
few
moments
the
drums
and
chanting
began
again
Oom
alla
boom
Oom
alla
BOOM
Ernie
could
see
a
fire
being
lit
beneath
the
huge
iron
pot
It
looked
as
though
the
Cannibals
were
going
to
have
their
feast
after
all
Ernie
s
attention
returned
to
the
conversation
inside
the
space
taxi
Ralph
was
telling
his
story
animatedly
so
I
wired
the
framistatter
to
the
quark
generator
Ralph
could
see
that
Captain
Memory
was
about
to
say
something
but
he
cut
him
off
Yeah
I
know
you
re
not
supposed
to
do
it
I
know
Warning
Do
Not
Bypass
Overload
Protection
Who
listens
to
that
crap
So
anyway
it
really
kicked
up
the
horsepower
you
know
what
I
mean
And
when
the
light
turned
green
man
I
was
outta
there
Those
guys
in
the
Vette
man
they
couldn
t
believe
it
You
shoulda
seen
their
faces
It
was
So
what
happened
Captain
Memory
interrupted
Ralph
became
suddenly
subdued
Okay
so
maybe
the
left
rear
antimatter
coupler
got
toasted
It
s
no
biggie
We
ll
stop
at
the
parts
store
we
ll
pick
up
a
new
one
It
s
just
a
couple
bucks
It
was
worth
it
You
shoulda
seen
those
guys
faces
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
I
got
some
bad
news
for
you
Ralph
The
parts
store
s
closed
Oh
MAN
Ralph
was
annoyed
You
mean
we
re
gonna
have
to
hang
out
until
the
store
opens
What
a
drag
Ralph
shook
his
head
unhappily
So
like
when
does
it
open
Captain
Memory
regarded
his
wrist
carefully
Let
s
see
it
s
right
now
So
I
would
say
it
ll
probably
open
in
about
oh
two
billion
years
Oh
MAN
Ralph
was
really
upset
I
can
t
wait
two
billion
years
I
got
a
date
on
Friday
Ernie
whimpered
Does
that
mean
the
ship
won
t
fly
Hey
be
cool
Ralph
said
comfortingly
Sure
it
ll
fly
It
s
just
a
little
uh
handling
problem
That
s
all
Fly
s
great
Just
doesn
t
uh
handle
exactly
right
It
was
beginning
to
occur
to
Ralph
that
perhaps
wiring
the
framisttater
to
the
quark
generator
might
not
have
been
such
a
good
idea
after
all
Handling
problem
inquired
Sterno
and
he
wriggled
about
trying
to
find
a
comfortable
position
in
the
upside
down
vehicle
Is
this
part
of
the
handling
problem
Hey
it
flies
fine
Ralph
insisted
So
maybe
it
s
upside
down
I
mean
And
sideways
Captain
Memory
reminded
Ralph
Oh
yeah
Ralph
became
quiet
Sideways
Okay
so
it
only
goes
upside
down
and
sideways
Hey
it
s
no
biggie
It
gets
you
where
you
re
going
right
Okay
so
maybe
you
wouldn
t
want
to
take
any
long
trips
in
it
right
now
but
it
get
s
you
Uh
well
it
gets
you
to
the
parts
store
he
concluded
triumphantly
The
parts
store
s
closed
Ralph
Captain
Memory
reminded
him
gently
The
Fly
s
antennae
suddenly
quivered
I
know
he
said
excitedly
How
about
Road
Service
Can
you
call
for
a
tow
Ralph
fidgeted
uncomfortably
Well
um
I
sorta
been
having
this
problem
with
the
towing
company
There
s
this
um
unpaid
balance
Ernie
and
the
Fly
looked
at
Captain
Memory
He
shrugged
Hey
I
don
t
got
insurance
you
know
Captain
Memory
suddenly
perked
up
Hey
Ralph
he
cried
What
about
Warp
drive
Ralph
brightened
and
then
slowly
resumed
his
glum
expression
Uh
well
I
don
t
think
you
wanna
use
the
Warp
drive
right
now
he
shook
his
head
sadly
Captain
Memory
frowned
Why
not
Ralph
fidgeted
Well
it
s
been
kinda
acting
up
a
little
he
explained
I
been
meaning
to
get
something
done
about
it
Just
yesterday
I
said
to
myself
Ralph
you
know
you
really
oughta
get
that
warp
drive
took
care
of
But
uh
you
know
it
s
like
fifty
credits
minimum
just
to
have
em
look
at
it
and
uh
He
trailed
off
Captain
Memory
looked
confused
Didn
t
you
get
the
Repair
Requisition
Voucher
from
the
Main
Office
Ralph
looked
very
uncomfortable
Um
uh
yeah
Well
the
other
night
me
and
the
boys
was
playing
a
little
cards
see
and
I
had
this
great
hand
I
had
three
Galaxies
How
could
I
lose
right
But
I
was
all
outta
chips
All
I
had
left
was
the
Voucher
so
I
said
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
That
s
against
the
rules
Ralph
Ralph
sighed
Well
how
was
I
to
know
the
other
guy
had
five
Nebulae
You
know
what
the
odds
against
that
are
Ernie
racked
his
brains
for
a
solution
to
the
problem
Maybe
we
could
just
sort
of
give
it
a
try
he
suggested
hopefully
Ralph
sighed
Well
I
thought
of
that
but
last
time
I
tried
it
I
wound
up
in
um
Dimension
Captain
Memory
was
startled
Dimension
Oh
no
wonder
He
chuckled
You
sure
don
t
wanna
wind
up
in
Dimension
do
you
Ralph
nodded
his
head
glumly
That
s
for
sure
They
all
fell
silent
After
a
few
minutes
Ernie
heard
the
sound
of
snoring
He
squinted
through
the
near
complete
darkness
the
only
light
coming
from
the
lights
on
the
dashboard
Ralph
seemed
to
have
dropped
off
to
sleep
Captain
Memory
seemed
to
be
nodding
as
well
Lacking
any
better
ideas
Ernie
slowly
worked
himself
around
to
a
comfortable
position
and
fell
asleep
as
well
CHAPTER
It
was
dawn
when
Ernie
awoke
During
the
night
the
Luna
C
seemed
to
have
drifted
quietly
to
the
ground
and
was
now
lying
on
it
s
top
in
the
dirt
Ernie
peered
out
the
windows
The
clearing
was
deserted
but
signs
of
last
night
s
revelry
remained
The
large
iron
pot
was
tipped
over
on
it
s
side
empty
Various
bones
lay
scattered
about
Lying
here
and
there
was
what
appeared
to
be
an
occasional
jackboot
Ernie
tried
not
to
look
at
them
After
a
few
moments
the
others
began
to
stir
The
Fly
moaned
Oh
man
I
hate
sleeping
in
the
car
Look
at
my
suit
It
s
all
rumpled
Only
Sterno
seemed
comfortable
curled
up
in
a
doglike
position
on
the
ceiling
of
the
upside
down
space
taxi
Ernie
twisted
uncomfortably
He
was
feeling
very
stiff
and
achy
after
sleeping
in
an
odd
position
in
the
car
Thinking
about
it
his
stomach
didn
t
feel
very
good
either
Captain
Memory
blinked
confusedly
and
looked
around
Ralph
yawned
The
Captain
looked
pointedly
at
Ralph
Well
he
said
unhappily
I
guess
there
s
no
getting
around
it
is
there
Oh
no
said
Ralph
dejectedly
You
gotta
do
it
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
despondently
You
re
gonna
have
to
call
the
office
Oh
MAN
Ralph
didn
t
seem
to
like
this
idea
at
all
I
hate
calling
the
office
They
always
give
me
a
hard
time
They
ll
probably
leave
me
on
hold
forever
too
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
It
s
gotta
be
done
Ralph
Ralph
sighed
Oh
okay
He
reached
under
the
seat
and
pulled
out
what
appeared
to
be
a
car
phone
He
picked
up
the
handset
and
dialed
looking
very
glum
Hi
Stella
it
s
Ralph
Ernie
could
only
hear
Ralph
s
side
of
the
conversation
Ralph
seemed
upset
Look
Stella
don
t
start
up
with
me
okay
I
m
having
a
bad
day
okay
Look
it
wasn
t
my
fault
Anyway
I
gotta
talk
to
the
boss
is
he
Oh
no
Stella
don
t
put
me
on
Suddenly
Ralph
froze
into
immobility
Ernie
peered
at
him
Ralph
was
absolutely
motionless
like
a
statue
He
didn
t
even
seem
to
be
breathing
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
What
happened
to
Ralph
Captain
Memory
seemed
unconcerned
Oh
they
put
him
on
hold
On
Hold
Ernie
was
uncomprehending
Captain
Memory
shrugged
Well
you
know
they
always
do
that
when
you
want
to
talk
to
the
boss
You
can
t
expect
him
to
drop
everything
just
to
talk
to
YOU
can
you
The
Captain
chuckled
at
the
thought
Ernie
peered
at
Ralph
He
s
not
breathing
No
he
doesn
t
need
to
He
s
in
suspended
animation
the
Captain
explained
yawning
and
stretching
That
way
you
re
not
aware
of
how
much
time
has
passed
while
you
re
waiting
for
your
connection
Ernie
frowned
I
don
t
think
I
d
like
that
Captain
Memory
shrugged
I
guess
they
feel
it
s
kinder
that
way
he
conjectured
Kinder
Ernie
was
having
a
hard
time
with
all
of
this
It
s
either
that
or
Muzak
Sterno
explained
Oh
Ernie
considered
this
Yeah
I
guess
suspended
animation
would
be
better
He
looked
over
at
Ralph
So
how
long
is
he
gonna
be
like
that
Let
me
see
Captain
Memory
examined
his
bare
wrist
closely
It
s
ten
o
clock
now
so
I
d
say
oh
about
two
billion
years
Two
billion
years
Ernie
was
aghast
Look
at
the
bright
side
Captain
Memory
went
on
cheerfully
By
then
the
parts
store
will
be
open
Ernie
moaned
What
are
we
supposed
to
do
in
the
meantime
Captain
Memory
frowned
Good
point
We
can
t
very
well
sit
around
here
can
we
He
chuckled
Might
as
well
hit
the
road
He
opened
the
car
door
and
flipped
himself
neatly
around
from
his
current
sitting
position
which
was
of
course
upside
down
relative
to
the
others
and
landed
neatly
on
his
feet
on
the
ground
outside
He
turned
to
Ernie
Coming
Ernie
crawled
painfully
out
through
the
open
car
door
and
struggled
to
his
feet
on
the
ground
outside
The
group
assembled
themselves
outside
the
upside
down
taxi
all
of
them
stretching
and
yawning
Ernie
peered
into
the
interior
of
the
taxi
until
he
spotted
his
coffee
maker
which
he
carefully
retrieved
He
stood
up
beside
the
taxi
and
looked
about
confusedly
Sterno
seemed
to
have
regained
his
composure
more
quickly
than
the
other
members
of
the
group
What
is
this
Office
that
you
and
Ralph
were
talking
about
he
asked
Captain
Memory
pointedly
The
Captain
looked
suddenly
uncomfortable
Well
uh
you
know
everybody
s
got
to
work
for
a
living
He
trailed
off
You
mean
you
re
not
a
full
time
Super
Hero
the
Fly
inquired
He
seemed
disappointed
Captain
Memory
shuffled
awkwardly
Well
uh
you
know
Super
Hero
ing
doesn
t
pay
too
good
What
exactly
do
you
do
at
this
Office
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Oh
you
know
a
little
programming
The
Captain
seemed
evasive
Oh
said
Sterno
with
relish
This
is
beginning
to
make
a
lot
more
sense
to
me
now
THAT
S
how
you
manage
to
do
all
these
tricky
things
here
in
Cyberspace
You
re
using
the
Company
computer
You
ve
got
a
mainframe
to
work
with
don
t
you
Well
Captain
Memory
seemed
very
uncomfortable
Sterno
continued
I
bet
you
re
not
running
all
this
from
a
PC
Well
no
the
Captain
admitted
I
got
a
Cray
A
CRAY
Even
Ernie
who
knew
very
little
about
computers
had
heard
of
the
awesome
power
of
a
Cray
Well
it
s
not
mine
personally
you
understand
the
Captain
began
defensively
In
other
words
Sterno
said
reflectively
You
re
using
the
Company
s
Cray
to
break
into
Waldo
Stadium
s
stolen
systems
and
free
the
Cyberslaves
Sterno
s
eyes
narrowed
Aren
t
you
supposed
to
be
doing
something
more
productive
Hey
this
is
important
Captain
Memory
insisted
indignantly
Anyway
it
s
part
of
R
D
you
know
After
all
I
could
He
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
thunderous
BOOM
BOOM
BOOM
of
jungle
drums
A
distant
chanting
reached
their
ears
Ernie
struggled
to
make
it
out
It
seemed
to
be
something
like
Oom
alla
boom
YUM
YUM
YUM
Maybe
we
should
um
get
moving
Ernie
suggested
Uh
sure
The
Captain
agreed
glad
to
change
the
subject
Let
s
go
He
began
striding
purposefully
forward
He
walked
right
up
to
an
impenetrable
thicket
and
stopped
looking
at
it
confusedly
How
about
this
trail
Ernie
suggested
pointing
to
a
narrow
path
that
led
through
the
underbrush
in
the
opposite
direction
from
the
trail
they
had
come
in
on
It
was
also
luckily
leading
the
opposite
direction
from
the
jungle
drums
Captain
Memory
snapped
his
fingers
Of
course
That
s
it
A
trail
We
need
a
trail
Now
why
didn
t
I
think
of
that
Good
question
Sterno
agreed
Captain
Memory
headed
purposefully
down
the
trail
the
others
following
behind
him
Within
seconds
the
forest
seemed
to
close
in
around
them
Ernie
could
see
nothing
around
him
but
dense
underbrush
All
he
could
see
ahead
of
him
was
Captain
Memory
s
back
He
supposed
that
he
didn
t
have
much
alternative
except
to
just
keep
moving
along
the
trail
At
least
the
sound
of
the
jungle
drums
was
diminishing
Ernie
began
to
be
aware
of
a
sound
in
the
distance
A
sort
of
whooshing
sound
It
sounded
almost
like
distant
traffic
noises
He
considered
it
It
was
probably
just
the
wind
in
the
trees
he
decided
Captain
Memory
stopped
abruptly
causing
Ernie
to
just
about
pile
into
his
back
Hmm
he
said
peering
intently
forward
You
can
get
through
that
opening
right
there
the
Fly
s
voice
came
from
behind
As
usual
his
hyper
acute
vision
had
spotted
details
which
everyone
else
missed
Captain
Memory
pushed
through
a
narrow
gap
in
the
bushes
The
others
followed
Pushing
through
the
dense
brush
Ernie
emerged
on
to
a
clearing
No
it
was
a
lawn
A
big
mowed
lawn
About
fifty
yards
ahead
was
a
large
parking
lot
followed
by
a
huge
chrome
and
glass
office
building
In
the
distance
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
major
highway
from
which
Ernie
could
hear
what
were
indeed
traffic
sounds
HEY
A
gruff
voice
interrupted
them
Huh
Ernie
looked
around
confusedly
Get
outta
da
flower
bed
Ernie
looked
down
He
was
standing
on
top
of
a
dozen
beautiful
but
crushed
tulips
NOW
the
voice
demanded
Ernie
rushed
forward
onto
the
grass
destroying
dozens
more
beautiful
flowers
in
the
process
Ernie
looked
back
to
see
the
rest
of
the
group
carefully
picking
their
way
forward
through
the
flowers
careful
not
to
cause
any
more
damage
Ernie
looked
up
to
see
the
owner
of
the
gruff
voice
approaching
He
was
a
short
heavy
set
man
in
coveralls
smoking
a
cigar
He
appeared
to
be
the
groundskeeper
He
glanced
at
the
group
and
singled
out
Ernie
Look
whatcha
did
to
my
flowers
Whatsa
matter
with
you
kids
anyway
You
wanna
use
the
Park
you
follow
the
rules
You
stay
on
the
trail
you
don
t
go
walking
through
the
flower
beds
Park
Ernie
was
uncomprehending
Poodawumpus
Park
the
gardener
repeated
insistently
What
you
just
came
outta
You
stay
on
the
trail
you
follow
the
signs
you
don
t
be
tearin
up
the
bushes
He
glared
at
the
entire
group
Um
we
didn
t
see
any
signs
the
Fly
said
carefully
Aaah
the
damn
kids
tore
up
the
signs
again
Little
brats
I
ll
kill
em
The
groundskeeper
chomped
his
cigar
angrily
Um
there
were
these
natives
Ernie
began
uncertainly
Yeah
o
course
there
s
natives
It
s
a
nature
park
There
s
natural
natives
in
it
He
looked
at
Ernie
suspiciously
You
didn
t
feed
the
natives
didja
No
no
Ernie
protested
We
didn
t
even
get
near
em
Good
The
groundskeeper
seemed
slightly
placated
They
eat
what
s
not
on
their
diet
it
makes
em
sick
He
continued
to
regard
the
group
suspiciously
You
didn
t
leave
no
junk
in
there
didja
Damn
kids
party
in
there
on
weekends
leave
the
trail
fulla
junk
I
once
hadda
haul
a
whole
junk
car
outta
there
He
glared
accusingly
at
the
foursome
No
no
Ernie
protested
We
re
real
neat
We
never
litter
We
don
t
allow
no
dogs
on
the
trail
neither
He
glared
at
Sterno
Sign
says
so
right
at
da
entrance
Um
we
didn
t
see
the
Fly
began
Yeah
yeah
I
know
Damn
kids
stole
da
sign
Awright
I
ll
letcha
off
dis
time
but
next
time
I
swear
I
m
gonna
calla
cops
We
re
real
sorry
Ernie
began
edging
away
It
won
t
happen
again
The
group
started
moving
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
office
building
Yeah
yeah
the
groundskeeper
was
looking
ruefully
at
his
crushed
flowers
The
Fly
shook
his
head
Boy
is
he
gonna
be
mad
when
he
finds
the
Luna
Sssh
Sterno
warned
What
the
groundskeeper
turned
back
to
them
Uh
have
a
nice
day
Ernie
said
quickly
Good
bye
He
waved
cheerfully
and
started
walking
quickly
towards
the
office
building
The
others
followed
Ernie
was
confused
Why
is
there
an
office
building
here
he
asked
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
Looks
like
it
s
somebody
s
architecture
program
I
ve
heard
of
that
Sterno
commented
The
architects
model
a
building
in
Virtual
Reality
so
that
the
clients
can
see
if
they
like
it
or
not
before
it
s
actually
built
Well
we
might
as
well
take
a
look
at
their
handiwork
the
Captain
decided
The
continued
over
the
large
parking
lot
that
lay
in
front
of
them
It
was
almost
empty
only
an
occasional
car
was
parked
here
and
there
They
soon
reached
the
doors
of
the
building
and
entered
In
front
of
them
lay
a
small
utilitarian
lobby
typical
of
cheaply
constructed
office
buildings
In
the
center
of
the
lobby
was
a
booth
marked
Information
but
there
was
no
one
manning
it
Most
of
the
offices
appeared
to
be
closed
On
the
wall
was
a
directory
to
the
offices
in
the
building
which
the
Fly
was
reading
carefully
Mostly
lawyers
he
said
ruefully
We
may
need
a
lawyer
after
all
the
damage
HE
s
caused
Sterno
said
looking
at
Ernie
accusingly
Me
Ernie
protested
Oh
look
the
Fly
broke
in
There
s
an
office
that
s
open
He
pointed
down
a
long
corridor
Great
Ernie
enthused
glad
for
an
opportunity
to
change
the
subject
Maybe
we
can
go
in
and
ask
He
stopped
and
looked
at
Captain
Memory
expectantly
Uh
what
should
we
ask
them
Good
idea
Captain
Memory
agreed
although
Ernie
wasn
t
exactly
sure
what
it
was
that
the
Captain
was
agreeing
with
The
Captain
started
off
briskly
down
the
hall
in
the
direction
of
the
open
office
The
other
three
followed
behind
him
Ah
good
you
re
here
We
ve
been
expecting
you
An
efficient
looking
receptionist
in
a
crisp
white
uniform
greeted
them
cheerfully
See
the
Fly
pointed
out
brightly
They
ve
been
expecting
us
Therefore
we
must
be
in
the
right
place
The
Fly
was
quite
pleased
with
this
leap
of
logic
Ernie
looked
around
They
were
in
a
large
waiting
room
decorated
in
doctor
s
office
green
The
room
was
filled
with
rows
of
chairs
and
an
occasional
table
on
which
there
lay
heaps
of
very
old
magazines
In
the
background
some
easy
listening
music
was
playing
quietly
There
was
as
usual
no
one
else
there
Ernie
moaned
Oh
man
Why
would
they
be
expecting
us
We
re
not
even
supposed
to
be
here
What
s
going
ON
The
Fly
shook
his
head
I
dunno
man
sometimes
you
can
be
just
such
a
downer
Why
don
t
you
like
lighten
up
a
little
Obviously
sniffed
Sterno
We
must
be
in
the
right
place
because
they
are
after
all
expecting
us
How
could
they
be
expecting
us
if
we
weren
t
in
the
right
place
But
Ernie
began
The
receptionist
interrupted
The
doctor
will
see
you
now
She
opened
a
door
to
another
room
Oh
good
The
Fly
was
pleased
You
know
I
ve
been
having
this
pain
in
my
neck
He
began
rubbing
it
vigorously
Maybe
he
can
give
me
something
for
it
He
strode
purposefully
through
the
door
Ernie
shuffled
uncomfortably
I
hate
going
to
the
doctor
Oh
come
ON
Sterno
stood
impatiently
behind
Ernie
Don
t
be
such
a
baby
about
it
Ernie
sighed
and
followed
the
Fly
accompanied
by
Sterno
and
Captain
Memory
They
found
themselves
in
a
large
room
with
a
dozen
chairs
set
in
a
circle
A
few
of
the
chairs
were
occupied
In
one
a
fat
blond
woman
sat
nervously
munching
something
from
a
bag
on
her
lap
Two
chairs
to
the
left
sat
a
very
depressed
looking
young
man
wringing
his
hands
constantly
and
moaning
quietly
He
looked
steadfastly
at
the
floor
never
looking
up
A
little
further
on
sat
a
dishevelled
wild
eyed
man
who
kept
constantly
lighting
matches
Every
time
one
lit
he
would
laugh
hysterically
Against
one
wall
was
a
chair
that
was
larger
than
the
others
In
it
sat
an
older
man
in
an
old
fashioned
black
suit
He
was
bald
with
a
goatee
beard
and
smoked
a
cigar
He
carried
a
notepad
and
seemed
to
be
taking
notes
on
everything
that
was
happening
He
looked
up
Ah
gut
He
smiled
at
the
foursome
You
are
chust
in
time
for
ze
group
therapy
session
Please
sit
down
He
gestured
towards
the
empty
chairs
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
from
the
other
patients
The
foursome
sat
down
Ernie
carefully
placed
the
coffee
maker
by
his
side
Oh
you
must
be
the
doctor
The
Fly
observed
He
looked
around
confusedly
But
what
kind
of
doctor
are
you
A
psychiatrist
of
course
The
doctor
replied
You
have
been
having
hmm
some
problems
in
regard
to
your
appearance
ja
That
s
right
The
Fly
was
amazed
He
turned
to
the
others
I
wonder
how
he
knew
that
Sterno
looked
at
the
doctor
s
cigar
excitedly
I
say
you
wouldn
t
happen
to
have
an
extra
cigar
would
you
The
psychiatrist
produced
one
from
an
inner
pocket
of
his
jacket
Thanks
ever
so
much
Sterno
lit
the
cigar
and
puffed
contentedly
Ernie
was
suspicious
You
ve
got
a
German
accent
he
said
accusingly
The
psychiatrist
drew
himself
up
looking
very
offended
Dat
s
an
AUSTRIAN
accent
he
sniffed
I
have
studied
in
Vienna
with
ze
great
Dr
Freud
himself
He
peered
closely
at
Ernie
Zo
you
have
zis
feeling
zat
you
are
being
persecuted
ja
Zat
everyone
is
against
you
Ernie
was
taken
aback
Well
um
now
that
you
mention
it
yeah
Chust
as
ve
thought
the
psychiatrist
said
scribbling
something
on
his
notepad
Classic
paranoia
Ernie
was
about
to
protest
when
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
two
more
patients
entered
Ernie
looked
up
and
then
moaned
It
was
Lucy
and
Desi
Hi
guys
Lucy
waved
brightly
to
the
foursome
Chick
a
BOOM
agreed
Desi
He
seemed
to
have
acquired
a
new
Cuban
shirt
and
another
pair
of
maracas
They
sat
down
on
the
unoccupied
chairs
across
from
the
psychiatrist
Gut
exclaimed
the
doctor
Now
ve
are
all
here
ve
can
begin
He
turned
to
Lucy
Now
Lucy
last
veek

telling
us
about
your
problem
Oh
doctor
Lucy
exclaimed
It
s
all
those
TV
shows
from
Earth
They
re
driving
me
crazy
Ach
zo
The
psychiatrist
exclaimed
quietly
Und
vhy
is
dat
Oh
doctor
Lucy
exclaimed
again
Every
time
we
turn
on
our
Vidicom
sets
on
my
home
planet
all
we
get
is
old
TV
shows
from
Earth
Our
sets
are
very
sensitive
and
your
signals
keep
drowning
ours
out
I
zee
said
the
doctor
thoughtfully
Und
you
find
zis
upsetting
Oh
doctor
cried
Lucy
again
We
re
not
humans
We
re
reptiles
We
don
t
wanna
watch
Earth
TV
shows
They
re
all
about
mammals
Lassie
My
Friend
Flicka
Leave
it
to
Beaver
They
re
all
MAMMALS
We
want
to
watch
our
OWN
TV
shows
About
REPTILES
She
seemed
very
upset
Ach
zo
the
doctor
nodded
Und
you
think
dat
if
you
conquer
ze
Earth
you
vould
feel
better
ja
Oh
doctor
Lucy
seemed
very
agitated
Don
t
you
see
We
ve
got
to
do
something
to
stop
those
TV
signals
We
just
can
t
stand
it
anymore
They
re
driving
us
CRAZY
The
doctor
nodded
thoughtfully
scribbling
notes
on
his
pad
He
thought
for
a
moment
But
you
are
light
years
from
here
so
you
are
just
now
receiving
signals
from
years
ago
ja
Yes
Lucy
agreed
tentatively
Zo
the
psychiatrist
continued
thoughtfully
Even
if
you
stop
ze
signals
today
you
vill
continue
to
receive
ze
signals
zat
have
already
been
sent
You
vill
continue
to
receive
ze
Earth
TV
shows
He
paused
expectantly
for
ze
NEXT
YEARS
NO
Lucy
screamed
She
buried
her
face
in
her
arms
sobbing
hysterically
I
can
t
stand
it
I
just
can
t
stand
it
She
continued
to
sob
uncontrollably
Ricky
patted
her
back
Chick
a
BOOM
he
said
commiseratingly
The
Fly
s
eyes
clouded
sympathetically
Aw
gee
His
antennae
waved
in
consternation
I
hate
to
see
a
woman
cry
Sterno
nodded
sagely
I
suppose
I
can
see
her
point
He
thought
for
a
moment
I
ve
always
rather
enjoyed
Lassie
though
A
thought
popped
into
Ernie
s
head
What
about
Rin
Tin
Tin
Not
bad
Sterno
agreed
thoughtfully
puffing
on
his
cigar
He
looked
almost
like
a
canine
version
of
the
psychiatrist
And
then
there
s
Sgt
Preston
of
the
Yukon
It
wouldn
t
be
a
bad
show
if
only
King
could
get
rid
of
that
silly
fellow
in
the
red
suit
MAMMALS
Lucy
screamed
sobbing
with
renewed
intensity
The
psychiatrist
stroked
his
beard
thoughtfully
Zere
is
perhaps
a
solution
Yes
Lucy
looked
up
expectantly
her
makeup
streaked
by
tears
It
seemed
to
Ernie
that
he
could
see
a
hint
of
something
green
beneath
it
Perhaps
ze
time
machine
the
doctor
seemed
deep
in
thought
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
in
confusion
Time
machine
he
whispered
It
isn
t
a
real
time
machine
the
Captain
explained
It
s
a
Virtual
time
machine
You
aren
t
actually
travelling
through
time
but
you
might
as
well
be
Like
when
we
went
back
to
four
billion
B
C
Oh
Ernie
was
not
exactly
following
this
but
he
noticed
the
others
glaring
at
him
so
he
decided
to
stop
The
psychiatrist
continued
Perhaps
you
could
go
back
in
time
back
years
und
stop
zese
signals
before
zey
start
Oh
doctor
Lucy
cried
hopefully
Do
you
really
think
it
would
work
Stop
TV
cried
the
Fly
obviously
very
upset
at
the
thought
Oh
no
How
could
we
survive
without
TV
It
would
be
the
end
of
of
The
Fly
tried
hard
to
think
what
it
would
be
the
end
of
Of
civilization
AS
WE
KNOW
IT
he
cried
triumphantly
True
the
psychiatrist
agreed
pensively
Lucy
s
eyes
began
to
fill
with
tears
But
perhaps
the
doctor
continued
slowly
Lucy
peered
at
him
expectantly
The
psychiatrist
went
on
Perhaps
it
would
not
be
stopped
but
chust
changed
a
little
So
dot
it
vould
not
be
a
bother
to
ze
space
creatures
Lucy
sat
up
excitedly
Oh
yes
Yes
She
turned
to
Ricky
Oh
Ricky
We
could
do
it
I
know
we
could
do
it
If
only
we
had
a
time
machine
The
psychiatrist
smiled
Vell
as
a
matter
of
fact
I
chust
happen
to
have
one
right
here
He
gestured
towards
a
door
that
Ernie
had
assumed
was
a
closet
Ernie
was
once
again
suspicious
What
would
a
psychiatrist
be
doing
with
a
time
machine
he
wanted
to
know
Oh
it
is
chust
ze
thing
for
ze
childhood
trauma
the
doctor
explained
You
go
back
in
time
prevent
ze
traumatic
incident
und
ze
patient
is
cured
Ernie
had
to
admit
that
this
did
in
fact
sound
reasonable
The
psychiatrist
peered
intently
at
Ernie
Vhen
did
you
first
notice
dat
you
felt
suspicious
of
everyone
Ernie
was
somewhat
taken
aback
by
this
sudden
change
in
questioning
Um
actually
he
though
about
it
It
started
when
I
first
went
into
the
Virtual
Arcade
Bye
guys
Lucy
interrupted
She
and
Ricky
were
standing
at
the
door
of
the
closet
or
time
machine
or
whatever
it
was
We
re
going
into
the
past
now
so
we
probably
won
t
be
seeing
you
anymore
Take
it
easy
cried
the
Fly
cheerfully
He
was
relieved
that
Lucy
had
stopped
crying
Um
A
thought
occurred
to
Ernie
Does
that
mean
that
you
re
not
