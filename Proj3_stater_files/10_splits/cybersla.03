he
said
enthusiastically
I
like
the
suit
It
s
the
new
in
thing
right
Sterno
regarded
Ernie
critically
Why
are
you
still
carrying
that
ridiculous
plastic
broadsword
Ernie
shifted
uncomfortably
Hey
I
told
you
it
s
a
forty
buck
deposit
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
Hopeless
Ernie
sat
down
in
a
comfortable
looking
chair
He
thought
he
had
better
take
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
rest
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
how
long
all
of
this
craziness
was
going
to
continue
So
like
what
s
with
that
Lucy
chick
the
Fly
asked
Captain
Memory
I
mean
like
what
s
her
problem
Oh
she
s
an
alien
explained
the
Captain
A
what
You
know
the
Captain
went
on
Come
from
outer
space
invade
the
Earth
steal
your
brain
that
kinda
stuff
The
Captain
made
himself
comfortable
on
a
small
sofa
and
began
leafing
through
his
copy
of
the
TV
Guide
Aliens
Ernie
asked
confusedly
Are
they
really
aliens
There
as
real
as
anything
in
Cyberspace
I
suppose
the
Captain
commented
But
what
are
they
DOING
here
Ernie
wanted
to
know
They
re
part
of
a
game
called
MENACE
FROM
PLANET
ZERO
It
s
quite
popular
the
Captain
explained
I
figured
we
d
run
across
it
sooner
or
later
With
all
the
systems
Waldo
s
been
taking
over
the
odds
are
that
it
d
be
in
at
least
one
of
them
The
Fly
seemed
a
bit
skeptical
Well
gee
that
chick
sure
didn
t
look
like
an
alien
The
Captain
was
impatient
She
s
in
disguise
of
course
You
wouldn
t
want
to
see
what
she
really
looks
like
He
shuddered
Anyway
he
continued
That
whole
bunch
are
aliens
in
disguise
They
ve
been
watching
our
s
TV
shows
and
they
think
those
TV
characters
are
normal
Earth
people
They
think
if
they
disguise
themselves
as
s
TV
characters
you
Earth
people
will
never
know
the
difference
They
don
t
seem
to
be
very
smart
Ernie
commented
Well
you
know
said
the
Captain
thoughtfully
Intelligence
is
not
the
only
way
to
approach
reality
There
are
other
ways
of
thinking
It
s
possible
to
approach
problem
solving
from
an
entirely
different
perspective
There
are
civilizations
in
which
thinking
is
done
in
an
entirely
different
way
where
intelligence
is
replaced
by
a
whole
different
way
of
looking
at
the
universe
Ernie
had
never
heard
Captain
Memory
get
so
philosophical
before
So
do
these
aliens
have
a
completely
different
way
of
thinking
he
asked
wonderingly
No
said
the
Captain
reflectively
They
re
just
stupid
He
returned
to
his
TV
Guide
I
mighta
known
said
the
Fly
reflectively
After
all
she
s
hanging
out
with
that
Ricky
guy
Man
he
s
something
else
Anybody
who
d
wear
a
shirt
like
that
He
trailed
off
looking
sideways
at
Ernie
A
number
of
magazines
were
scattered
about
an
end
table
next
to
Ernie
s
chair
A
headline
in
one
of
the
caught
Ernie
s
eye
FANTASTIC
ARCHAEOLOGICAL
FIND
REVEALED
Ernie
picked
it
up
and
began
to
read
On
October
an
Arab
shepherd
following
a
stray
animal
into
a
cave
near
the
Sea
of
Galilee
made
an
incredible
find
a
find
unparalleled
in
modern
history
A
find
so
monumental
so
earth
shattering
so
threatening
to
world
governments
and
religious
institutions
that
its
very
existence
has
been
suppressed
Only
now
by
means
of
smuggled
documents
obtained
at
great
personal
risk
to
all
involved
can
this
fabulous
story
come
to
light
the
story
of
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Ernie
was
intrigued
He
read
on
Our
story
must
really
begin
in
Ancient
Egypt
deep
in
the
mysteries
of
the
Middle
Kingdom
an
age
which
produced
some
of
the
greatest
wonders
the
world
has
even
seen
Some
of
these
like
the
Pyramids
have
been
known
to
the
world
for
millennia
Yet
it
stands
to
reason
that
any
people
capable
of
producing
wonders
like
these
wonders
which
the
modern
world
has
yet
to
equal
must
also
have
been
capable
of
producing
many
other
amazing
things
on
a
smaller
scale
Yet
all
of
these
have
been
lost
in
the
sands
of
time
or
have
they
Let
us
consider
for
a
moment
the
phonograph
a
relatively
simple
device
invented
in
the
last
century
by
Thomas
Edison
In
its
basic
form
it
consists
of
a
disc
or
even
a
cylinder
driven
by
a
crank
that
comes
in
contact
with
a
needle
attached
to
a
cone
One
can
then
either
play
or
record
simply
by
turning
the
crank
and
either
speaking
into
the
cone
or
listening
That
s
all
there
is
to
it
A
simple
device
like
this
can
be
made
with
almost
anyone
with
basic
tools
It
could
have
been
made
thousands
of
years
ago
it
could
even
have
been
made
by
the
ancient
Egyptians
Certainly
any
civilization
capable
of
producing
incredible
engineering
feats
like
the
Pyramids
would
be
capable
of
constructing
a
simple
mechanical
device
like
this
Now
there
is
evidence
that
they
did
In
the
tomb
of
the
Pharaoh
Pepto
II
at
Bismol
hieroglyphics
have
been
found
which
bear
an
uncanny
resemblance
to
Edison
s
early
phonographs
Along
with
these
were
others
which
were
translated
to
read
and
the
voice
of
the
Pharaoh
shall
speak
on
after
he
is
gone
and
fragment
missing
that
we
who
are
as
dogs
to
the
mighty
Pharaoh
shall
listen
to
Our
Master
s
Voice
Ernie
looked
at
the
accompanying
illustration
It
was
a
picture
from
an
Egyptian
tomb
showing
a
dog
listening
to
some
kind
of
a
device
with
a
cone
coming
out
of
it
It
reminded
Ernie
of
something
Didn
t
it
look
a
lot
like
the
RCA
Victor
logo
Then
again
maybe
not
He
continued
reading
But
this
is
only
the
beginning
It
would
be
monumental
enough
if
records
of
the
voices
of
the
Pharaohs
had
been
found
but
what
has
actually
been
discovered
is
so
spectacular
as
to
make
the
Pharaohs
seem
trivial
by
comparison
It
was
of
course
phonograph
records
that
the
Arab
shepherd
found
They
were
in
the
form
of
discs
made
of
fine
clay
a
material
much
more
durable
than
the
perishable
vinyl
that
our
present
day
phonograph
records
are
made
of
and
were
packed
in
the
crumbling
remains
of
an
Egyptian
style
case
When
played
at
approximately
rpm
they
produced
voices
much
like
our
own
early
phonograph
records
But
stop
and
consider
These
records
were
found
deep
in
Israel
near
the
Sea
of
Galilee
in
other
words
nowhere
near
the
Egypt
of
the
Pharaohs
There
is
no
evidence
that
the
phonograph
was
ever
used
in
ancient
Israel
what
s
more
they
were
in
an
Egyptian
style
case
and
bore
Egyptian
markings
How
could
they
have
come
to
a
cave
near
the
Sea
of
Galilee
There
is
only
one
way
They
must
have
been
brought
there
from
Egypt
by
the
fleeing
Israelites
Hieroglyphics
prove
that
the
phonograph
was
in
existence
at
this
time
what
would
have
been
more
reasonable
than
for
the
fleeing
Israelites
taking
with
them
the
treasures
of
Egypt
to
take
with
them
this
great
treasure
But
what
would
they
have
used
it
for
What
else
but
for
the
same
use
as
the
Pharaohs
to
record
and
preserve
the
voice
of
their
leader
so
that
his
will
can
be
known
forever
the
voice
of
Moses
Yet
if
this
device
the
phonograph
was
in
the
hands
of
Moses
wouldn
t
he
have
used
it
to
record
the
things
he
considered
of
greatest
importance
In
that
case
wouldn
t
he
have
taken
it
to
Mount
Sinai
Wouldn
t
he
have
used
it
to
record
the
voice
of
God
Himself
Now
you
can
see
why
this
find
has
been
suppressed
why
no
government
no
religious
institution
on
Earth
can
afford
to
let
these
records
be
heard
They
contain
at
the
very
least
the
voice
of
Moses
and
possibly
even
the
very
voice
of
God
There
may
be
things
on
these
records
which
could
change
the
life
of
every
man
woman
and
child
on
Earth
now
today
in
the
th
century
But
will
these
records
ever
be
heard
Or
will
they
be
hidden
away
in
a
secret
vault
kept
from
a
world
that
needs
them
so
desperately
They
must
be
heard
The
people
have
a
right
to
this
knowledge
knowledge
which
affects
each
and
every
one
of
them
in
every
facet
of
their
daily
lives
Right
now
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
where
they
are
being
held
or
by
whom
or
for
what
purpose
But
a
find
like
this
CANNOT
be
suppressed
It
is
to
earth
shaking
too
monumental
Word
WILL
leak
out
people
WILL
be
told
Already
this
has
begun
to
happen
secret
documents
have
been
smuggled
out
incontrovertible
evidence
has
been
uncovered
It
is
beginning
now
it
is
only
a
mater
of
time
before
the
world
learns
the
awesome
truth
about
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Ernie
put
the
magazine
down
Wow
he
thought
This
is
really
heavy
Is
this
for
real
or
is
this
just
more
crazy
nonsense
Did
this
really
happen
or
is
this
just
more
garbage
caused
by
sticking
together
too
many
computer
programs
that
don
t
belong
together
How
can
we
tell
the
difference
Ernie
thought
about
the
problem
This
is
an
important
question
he
decided
We
may
have
stumbled
onto
something
really
meaningful
Somebody
ought
to
look
into
this
Somebody
ought
to
find
out
whether
this
is
for
real
or
not
because
if
it
is
real
it
might
be
really
important
Ernie
stopped
He
hadn
t
the
vaguest
idea
how
somebody
would
go
about
looking
into
a
question
like
this
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
Here
look
at
this
article
He
handed
the
magazine
to
the
Captain
The
Captain
peered
at
the
article
The
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Get
real
Captain
Memory
tossed
the
magazine
over
his
shoulder
No
really
Ernie
protested
This
is
important
stuff
I
really
think
you
should
consider
it
What
if
this
really
happened
What
if
this
is
like
a
secret
CIA
computer
file
or
something
I
mean
stuff
like
that
could
be
here
right
It
s
possible
isn
t
it
Aything
s
possible
the
Captain
admitted
But
how
likely
is
it
Ernie
heard
snickering
coming
from
behind
him
He
turned
Sterno
had
picked
up
the
magazine
and
was
leafing
through
it
You
actually
READ
this
stuff
laughed
Sterno
Here
s
a
good
article
Princess
Diana
says
I
m
Carrying
Elvis
s
Baby
Or
how
about
I
Was
Raped
by
Killer
Lesbians
from
Outer
Space
Ernie
frowned
Something
about
that
last
headline
sounded
a
little
familiar
Sterno
continued
Here
another
one
Earth
invaded
by
Aliens
Disguised
as
s
TV
Characters
Hey
lemme
see
that
Ernie
reached
for
the
magazine
convinced
that
they
were
onto
something
What
trash
Sterno
dropped
the
magazine
in
the
wastebasket
Hey
Ernie
fished
through
the
wastebasket
trying
to
retrieve
the
magazine
Oh
no
it
s
all
covered
with
sticky
wine
The
pages
are
all
stuck
together
Wow
man
said
the
Fly
wonderingly
That
s
really
heavy
stuff
Imagine
that
Princess
Diana
pregnant
with
Elvis
s
baby
I
never
knew
that
Ernie
was
trying
to
separate
the
pages
of
the
magazine
but
the
Mad
Dog
wine
had
dissolved
most
of
the
ink
and
he
was
only
succeeding
in
making
a
big
mess
Did
you
really
think
you
were
going
to
find
the
secrets
of
the
universe
in
that
magazine
asked
Sterno
sarcastically
I
don
t
think
you
re
going
to
get
anywhere
with
that
stuff
added
Captain
Memory
I
think
you
re
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
I
suppose
you
think
that
s
funny
Sterno
snarled
He
regarded
Ernie
for
a
moment
You
know
that
little
hat
looks
really
ridiculous
Yeah
guy
the
Fly
chimed
in
How
come
you
re
wearing
that
Mickey
Mouse
hat
It
s
not
a
Mickey
Mouse
hat
alright
said
Ernie
frustrated
It
s
part
of
the
outfit
You
re
supposed
to
wear
this
kind
of
a
little
hat
I
dunno
why
you
re
just
supposed
to
Ernie
sulked
Leave
me
alone
Sterno
chuckled
The
only
good
thing
about
having
him
along
he
said
gesturing
at
Ernie
Is
that
he
can
always
cheer
me
up
If
I
didn
t
have
him
to
laugh
at
I
don
t
know
WHAT
I
d
do
Ernie
glowered
The
Fly
was
sitting
at
a
dressing
table
regarding
himself
in
the
mirror
He
kept
examining
various
bottle
of
cosmetics
holding
each
in
turn
up
to
his
face
but
he
couldn
t
find
any
that
matched
his
shell
tone
My
what
big
eyes
you
have
quipped
Sterno
How
about
some
eyeliner
Or
maybe
some
mascara
for
your
antenna
Aw
c
mon
guys
the
Fly
complained
Gimme
a
break
huh
I
was
just
looking
for
a
little
like
bronzer
y
know
Y
think
bronzer
would
look
good
on
me
His
antennae
waved
hopefully
Ernie
was
feeling
irritable
He
was
tired
of
everyone
picking
on
him
all
the
time
Why
do
you
keep
reading
that
TV
Guide
he
snapped
at
Captain
Memory
So
I
can
see
what
s
on
answered
the
Captain
reasonably
How
can
you
possibly
tell
what
s
on
when
you
don
t
even
know
where
we
are
You
re
never
gonna
have
the
right
listings
for
here
wherever
THIS
is
Sure
I
do
disagreed
the
Captain
I
ve
got
the
listings
for
everywhere
How
could
you
have
that
Ernie
was
skeptical
This
is
the
Inter
Continuum
Edition
with
Multi
Galactic
Sub
Listings
for
the
week
of
May
Infinity
explained
the
Captain
It
s
got
the
listings
for
all
of
Time
and
Space
Lemme
see
that
Ernie
snatched
it
rudely
out
of
Captain
Memory
s
hand
Why
the
pages
are
all
blank
Are
you
a
subscriber
the
Captain
wanted
to
know
gently
taking
the
book
back
out
of
Ernie
s
hands
Well
no
Ernie
admitted
Well
that
s
why
you
can
t
see
it
Ernie
sighed
He
guessed
that
made
as
much
sense
as
anything
else
CM
examined
the
listings
carefully
Wanna
watch
an
old
movie
Here
s
a
classic
Mr
Blandings
Builds
his
Dream
Horse
Ernie
frowned
You
mean
House
Captain
Memory
was
puzzled
Mr
House
Builds
his
Dream
Horse
Ernie
shook
his
head
No
no
It
s
supposed
to
be
Mr
Blandings
Builds
his
Dream
House
Captain
Memory
peered
at
the
TV
Guide
It
quite
clearly
says
here
Horse
That
s
ridiculous
Ernie
insisted
You
can
t
build
a
horse
That
s
right
the
Fly
chimed
in
At
least
not
without
a
permit
Huh
Ernie
was
taken
aback
And
an
inspection
the
Fly
went
on
I
mean
you
wouldn
t
want
to
ride
a
horse
that
was
built
without
a
permit
and
wasn
t
inspected
It
wouldn
t
be
safe
Uh
Something
about
this
didn
t
sound
right
to
Ernie
The
Fly
continued
with
enthusiasm
I
mean
like
what
if
you
took
this
horse
out
on
the
freeway
you
know
and
you
re
cruisin
along
doin
maybe
and
all
of
a
sudden
boom
A
leg
falls
off
Then
what
Somebody
could
get
hurt
Ernie
didn
t
know
how
to
argue
with
this
Uh
I
suppose
you
re
right
He
fell
silent
Captain
Memory
broke
the
silence
Hey
here
s
a
good
show
Follow
the
Yellow
Brick
Road
The
Fab
Four
stop
for
a
drink
at
The
Deer
Bar
and
meet
aliens
disguised
as
s
TV
characters
Starring
Lucille
Ball
Adam
West
and
Rin
Tin
Tin
How
about
that
Sounds
okay
to
me
said
the
Fly
agreeably
Ernie
looked
around
the
room
There
s
no
TV
he
said
triumphantly
Oh
there
s
always
a
TV
the
Captain
assured
him
Okay
where
Ernie
demanded
Hmm
Captain
Memory
looked
around
He
got
up
walked
over
to
the
dressing
table
and
peered
into
the
mirror
Let
s
try
this
Mirror
mirror
on
the
wall
Ain
t
there
no
TV
at
all
The
surface
of
the
mirror
dissolved
and
an
image
of
The
Deer
Bar
appeared
in
its
place
Four
characters
were
seated
at
the
bar
drinking
beer
So
what
are
we
gonna
do
now
guys
asked
the
Fly
sipping
a
beer
through
his
long
flexible
snout
Ernie
started
and
looked
about
confusedly
They
were
suddenly
all
back
at
The
Deer
Bar
His
stomach
flipped
over
again
What
uh
how
did
we
get
back
here
Same
way
we
got
out
said
Captain
Memory
gesturing
towards
the
TV
set
He
looked
momentarily
confused
Either
that
or
maybe
we
never
really
left
at
all
I
forget
which
Oh
well
it
doesn
t
really
matter
Ernie
looked
up
at
the
television
above
the
bar
which
now
was
turned
on
A
sadistic
Nazi
talk
show
host
was
using
a
diabolical
looking
device
to
torture
members
of
the
audience
Uh
do
you
mind
if
I
turn
that
off
asked
Ernie
If
you
like
answered
the
Captain
indifferently
Ernie
switched
off
the
set
and
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Now
they
were
safe
He
frowned
Well
maybe
they
weren
t
safe
but
they
were
safER
He
thought
about
it
a
moment
Well
maybe
they
weren
t
really
any
safer
but
turning
the
TV
off
made
him
feel
better
just
the
same
That
satisfied
him
so
he
returned
to
his
seat
The
Fly
looked
around
Like
we
re
the
only
ones
here
Uh
huh
Ernie
agreed
So
what
happened
to
like
Ricky
and
Lucy
As
if
in
answer
the
door
to
the
bar
flew
open
and
in
staggered
Ricky
his
ruffled
Cuban
shirt
in
rags
his
maracas
broken
Close
behind
him
was
Lucy
her
hair
disarrayed
her
party
dress
torn
and
smeared
with
dirt
You
feelthy
peeg
shrieked
Ricky
enraged
You
send
us
behind
door
numero
four
I
keel
you
What
did
he
say
the
Fly
asked
confusedly
I
can
t
understand
his
accent
at
all
I
think
he
said
he
was
going
to
keel
us
Sterno
volunteered
What
s
that
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
Something
to
do
with
boats
Ricky
advanced
on
the
foursome
holding
his
shattered
maracas
menacingly
Ernie
noticed
that
they
seemed
to
have
acquired
very
sharp
edges
I
keel
you
I
cut
your
brain
out
he
threatened
Ernie
Hey
he
s
starting
up
with
that
brain
stuff
again
Ernie
said
to
Captain
Memory
What
do
we
do
Have
a
beer
said
Captain
Memory
sipping
his
Deer
Beer
That
s
easy
for
you
to
say
It
s
not
your
brain
he
s
after
Ernie
looked
at
Ricky
apprehensively
Why
don
t
you
just
let
him
have
your
brain
snickered
Sterno
You
ll
never
miss
it
Ricky
slowly
staggered
forward
Ernie
noticed
that
Ricky
was
getting
much
more
sort
of
reptilian
looking
He
seemed
to
have
acquired
long
sharp
teeth
and
a
forked
tongue
which
flitted
in
and
out
of
his
mouth
in
a
snake
like
manner
Hey
uh
shouldn
t
we
uh
DO
something
Ernie
urged
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
looked
annoyed
Oh
all
right
He
cleared
his
throat
And
now
he
announced
pompously
A
word
from
our
sponsor
Ricky
froze
Oh
ees
a
commercial
he
said
to
Lucy
We
got
to
wait
Well
I
guess
we
d
better
get
going
fellas
Captain
Memory
said
to
the
other
three
We
ve
only
got
sixty
seconds
He
gulped
down
the
rest
of
his
beer
I
hate
to
drink
beer
in
a
hurry
It
upsets
my
stomach
He
burped
He
brushed
past
Ricky
and
Lucy
who
were
frozen
into
a
state
of
immobility
and
led
the
group
out
the
door
Once
outside
Captain
Memory
checked
his
bare
wrist
Hmm
ten
more
seconds
I
know
let
s
try
this
The
Captain
led
the
group
around
the
side
of
the
building
where
they
could
not
be
seen
from
the
main
door
Fifteen
seconds
later
Ricky
and
Lucy
burst
out
of
the
bar
door
Where
dey
go
Ricky
screamed
Dey
not
suppose
to
move
during
de
commercial
Dey
got
to
wait
for
de
show
to
start
again
Ricky
and
Lucy
looked
quickly
around
and
then
charged
off
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
bank
The
Fly
peeked
around
the
corner
Looks
like
they
re
gone
Ernie
frowned
Are
these
aliens
really
that
stupid
he
asked
the
Captain
I
m
afraid
so
Captain
Memory
replied
Ernie
frowned
Something
about
this
didn
t
seem
to
make
sense
If
they
re
so
stupid
how
come
they
ve
got
interstellar
travel
and
blasters
and
stuff
like
that
he
asked
pointedly
Well
you
know
aliens
have
brother
in
laws
too
Captain
Memory
explained
Brothers
in
law
Sterno
corrected
Uh
right
the
Captain
went
on
Uh
relatives
They
have
relatives
too
Everybody
has
relatives
So
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Captain
Memory
sighed
Well
what
do
you
do
if
your
brother
in
law
needs
a
job
but
he
s
not
too
um
bright
I
mean
you
can
t
leave
him
to
starve
right
After
all
he
s
married
to
your
sister
Okay
so
maybe
your
sister
doesn
t
have
real
good
taste
in
men
she
s
still
your
sister
right
And
what
about
your
nephews
Get
to
the
point
Sterno
demanded
impatiently
Okay
okay
Captain
Memory
went
on
Anyway
you
ve
got
to
get
him
a
job
but
you
don
t
want
to
get
him
anything
too
like
visible
because
you
know
he
s
going
to
screw
it
up
and
you
ll
get
blamed
So
you
get
him
a
job
that
pays
good
but
is
um
out
of
the
way
Like
for
instance
interstellar
scout
Sure
he
ll
screw
it
up
but
he
s
millions
of
light
years
away
who
s
gonna
know
Ernie
looked
crestfallen
I
always
thought
they
d
send
you
know
their
Top
Guns
their
best
and
brightest
to
attack
us
You
re
mean
they
send
their
screw
ups
to
invade
our
planet
Captain
Memory
shrugged
Well
you
know
it
s
a
bureaucracy
This
is
the
real
universe
Life
s
like
that
Ernie
sighed
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
Anyway
I
think
it
s
time
to
get
going
He
headed
off
purposefully
down
the
yellow
brick
road
going
in
the
opposite
direction
from
that
in
which
Ricky
and
Lucy
had
gone
The
group
trailed
along
behind
him
CHAPTER
Ernie
caught
up
to
Captain
Memory
as
the
foursome
headed
down
the
yellow
brick
road
So
where
are
we
anyway
he
wanted
to
know
The
Captain
looked
around
Could
be
Kansas
I
suppose
he
said
thoughtfully
You
don
t
KNOW
Captain
Memory
shrugged
You
can
t
expect
me
to
keep
track
of
all
these
PLACES
he
said
annoyedly
Do
you
know
how
many
PLACES
there
are
in
Cyberspace
There
s
there
s
He
hesitated
confusedly
Well
I
don
t
know
exactly
how
many
but
there
s
a
whole
lot
of
them
And
they
keep
changing
all
the
time
too
I
mean
you
can
go
someplace
you
know
real
well
you
come
back
in
a
few
nanoseconds
and
it
s
all
different
It
was
bad
enough
before
Waldo
Stadium
starting
networking
all
these
systems
that
were
never
meant
to
be
networked
Now
it
s
impossible
So
don
t
expect
ME
to
keep
track
of
it
It
isn
t
MY
fault
He
calmed
down
Anyway
he
said
more
composedly
I
guess
it
could
be
Nebraska
Ernie
peered
into
the
distance
What
s
all
that
smoke
He
pointed
to
a
large
cloud
on
the
horizon
The
Fly
looked
searchingly
into
the
distance
With
his
huge
multi
faceted
insect
eyes
he
could
see
more
clearly
than
any
human
That
s
not
smoke
that
s
dust
he
explained
There
s
a
whole
lot
of
trucks
and
cars
and
stuff
heading
this
way
There
s
enough
to
be
an
army
of
em
He
peered
into
the
distance
In
fact
it
IS
an
army
They
got
tanks
and
guns
and
everything
Ernie
felt
uneasy
So
whose
army
it
is
They
Fly
squinted
I
can
t
tell
too
much
dust
Maybe
we
should
just
get
out
of
the
way
and
let
them
go
by
Sterno
suggested
This
seemed
like
an
excellent
idea
to
Ernie
They
stepped
off
the
road
climbed
over
a
picturesque
split
rail
fence
and
made
their
way
into
a
cornfield
where
they
hid
themselves
among
the
tall
plants
Ernie
noticed
a
scarecrow
out
in
the
middle
of
the
field
He
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
but
then
he
decided
to
just
leave
it
alone
In
a
few
minutes
the
first
vehicles
of
the
military
column
began
to
pass
them
Ernie
noticed
that
they
were
armored
personnel
carriers
painted
tan
and
grey
On
the
side
of
each
was
the
insignia
of
a
palm
tree
with
a
swastika
at
the
base
Ernie
recognized
it
from
watching
war
movies
on
the
late
show
It
s
the
Afrika
Korps
he
whispered
to
Captain
Memory
What
would
they
be
doing
in
Kansas
or
maybe
Nebraska
Aha
said
Captain
Memory
quietly
So
that
s
it
Rommel
must
be
advancing
on
Omaha
Therefore
it
will
be
up
to
Prince
Eugene
to
stop
the
Turkish
hordes
at
the
gates
of
Vienna
In
that
case
Colonel
Jackson
must
be
heading
down
the
mighty
Mississippi
at
this
very
moment
taking
a
little
bacon
and
a
little
beans
to
fight
the
bloody
British
at
the
town
of
New
Orleans
That
means
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
wrist
It
must
be
Oh
Ernie
no
longer
expected
Captain
Memory
s
explanations
to
shed
much
light
on
things
although
thinking
about
it
something
about
the
last
part
of
Captain
Memory
s
explanation
did
sound
a
little
familiar
But
then
on
the
other
hand
everything
sounded
a
little
familiar
but
none
of
it
actually
made
any
sense
Ernie
decided
to
try
again
even
though
he
didn
t
have
much
hope
of
success
So
what
s
going
on
anyway
Isn
t
this
supposed
to
be
like
the
Wizard
of
Oz
or
something
I
don
t
remember
any
Nazi
armies
in
the
Wizard
of
Oz
The
Wizard
of
Oz
the
Captain
asked
wonderingly
Whatever
gave
you
that
idea
Well
gee
Ernie
had
thought
it
was
obvious
There
s
this
yellow
brick
road
and
the
bank
manager
was
kind
of
a
witch
and
she
had
ruby
slippers
and
He
trailed
off
So
what
the
Captain
demanded
Well
If
this
isn
t
the
Wizard
of
Oz
where
did
all
that
stuff
come
from
The
Captain
was
annoyed
Sure
some
of
this
is
from
THE
WIZARD
OF
OZ
But
some
of
it
isn
t
Some
of
it
s
from
other
games
or
computer
models
or
databases
or
whatever
happened
to
be
in
the
systems
that
Waldo
s
been
taking
over
And
there
s
no
way
to
tell
what
ll
pop
out
where
or
when
Even
Waldo
can
t
keep
track
of
it
It
s
taking
all
his
computing
power
just
to
keep
the
system
halfway
organized
so
it
doesn
t
crash
You
know
how
hard
it
is
to
keep
a
FATAL
ERROR
from
creeping
into
this
stuff
It
s
only
because
he
s
got
a
multiple
redundant
neural
net
system
that
he
can
keep
this
stuff
running
at
all
Ernie
moaned
He
didn
t
like
the
sound
of
that
FATAL
ERROR
business
One
thing
bothers
me
though
the
Captain
continued
watching
the
military
vehicles
go
by
These
Nazis
They
re
showing
up
way
too
often
They
may
be
somehow
picking
up
our
trail
You
mean
Waldo
Stadium
knows
where
we
are
Ernie
cried
anxiously
He
s
zeroing
in
on
us
Could
be
said
the
Captain
thoughtfully
It
doesn
t
seem
like
they
know
exactly
where
we
are
but
it
does
seem
like
they
know
we
re
around
here
somewhere
I
wonder
how
they
know
that
Ernie
sighed
again
He
would
have
to
remember
not
to
ask
for
explanations
anymore
They
just
made
things
worse
After
a
few
minutes
the
last
of
the
military
vehicles
passed
taking
with
it
the
last
of
the
huge
cloud
of
dust
Ernie
coughed
He
and
the
others
were
all
covered
with
a
thick
layer
of
dirt
He
looked
at
himself
All
the
sparkle
was
gone
from
his
toreador
suit
Sterno
shook
himself
vigorously
sending
dust
flying
in
all
directions
Hey
watch
it
the
Fly
complained
That
stuff
gets
in
my
eyes
you
know
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
How
come
you
re
not
covered
with
dirt
he
demanded
Oh
it
s
the
suit
Captain
Memory
explained
fingering
his
comic
book
character
outfit
It
s
got
that
dirt
repelling
stuff
you
know
the
kind
you
put
in
the
dryer
Ernie
examined
his
toreador
outfit
On
the
inside
he
found
a
small
tag
Just
my
luck
Ernie
thought
Dry
Clean
Only
They
made
their
way
back
on
to
the
road
and
continued
in
the
same
direction
they
had
been
heading
before
the
convoy
went
by
A
light
breeze
sprang
up
and
carried
away
the
worst
of
the
dust
After
walking
for
a
few
minutes
Ernie
noticed
a
house
in
the
distance
As
they
approached
Ernie
could
see
that
it
was
an
elaborate
Victorian
cottage
covered
with
gingerbread
style
ornamentation
Hey
let
s
stop
in
the
Fly
suggested
Maybe
we
can
get
a
drink
of
water
All
this
dust
is
really
buggin
me
Oh
it
s
bugging
you
asked
Sterno
maliciously
Yeah
the
Fly
answered
ingenuously
Sterno
shrugged
There
was
no
point
in
sniping
at
people
who
were
too
dense
to
understand
it
As
they
neared
the
cottage
Ernie
noticed
that
it
was
surrounded
by
a
white
picket
fence
However
a
large
section
of
the
fence
had
been
knocked
over
The
lawn
seemed
to
be
all
chewed
up
as
though
by
the
treads
of
a
tank
Heading
up
the
front
walk
Ernie
noticed
the
door
was
broken
off
it
s
hinges
As
they
climbed
the
porch
Ernie
noticed
that
the
gingerbread
on
the
cottage
was
actual
gingerbread
the
edible
kind
Ernie
broke
off
a
piece
and
sniffed
it
It
seemed
fresh
He
took
a
bite
Very
tasty
he
thought
He
suddenly
realized
that
he
hadn
t
had
anything
to
eat
for
a
really
long
time
The
shutters
looked
interesting
they
had
frosting
and
raisins
Oh
wow
what
happened
here
Ernie
heard
the
Fly
ask
He
looked
through
the
door
Inside
were
obvious
signs
of
a
struggle
The
quaint
German
style
furniture
was
scattered
about
The
walls
were
pockmarked
with
bullet
holes
On
one
side
of
the
room
was
a
large
cast
iron
stove
Next
to
the
stove
stood
a
large
cage
with
its
door
open
The
stove
was
red
hot
and
a
bad
smell
came
from
it
Captain
Memory
considered
the
scene
and
regarded
the
tank
tracks
and
bullet
holes
Looks
like
whoever
was
here
got
arrested
by
the
Nazis
he
commented
Ernie
thought
about
this
Hansel
and
Gretel
arrested
by
the
Nazis
But
then
again
Hansel
and
Gretel
is
a
German
story
isn
t
it
In
that
case
Ernie
decided
it
s
none
of
my
business
I
won
t
worry
about
it
Instead
he
decided
to
look
for
something
else
to
eat
Ernie
found
an
old
fashioned
icebox
which
seemed
to
be
full
of
pies
cakes
and
other
goodies
There
didn
t
seem
to
be
anything
by
way
of
regular
wholesome
food
though
Oh
well
thought
Ernie
cutting
into
a
Bavarian
Black
Forest
Torte
I
guess
I
ll
just
have
to
rough
it
Sterno
was
helping
himself
to
an
eclair
Very
nice
he
commented
Would
you
mind
handing
me
a
piece
of
that
double
chocolate
rum
cheesecake
Hey
this
is
good
stuff
the
Fly
added
vacuuming
up
a
dish
of
frosted
ginger
snaps
through
his
long
snout
Ernie
stopped
Hey
how
do
we
know
this
stuff
is
okay
I
mean
maybe
this
is
an
alien
trap
or
something
Maybe
this
stuff
is
poisoned
Sterno
sniffed
disgustedly
We
can
always
count
on
you
to
say
something
utterly
inappropriate
at
the
table
can
t
we
Comments
like
that
can
ruin
everyone
s
appetite
The
first
decent
thing
we
ve
had
to
eat
on
this
entire
ridiculous
escapade
and
you
have
to
go
and
spoil
it
Ernie
was
upset
Well
okay
maybe
you
re
right
That
s
not
dinner
table
conversation
But
still
how
do
we
know
Sterno
sighed
The
problem
with
you
is
that
you
have
no
sense
of
smell
I
for
one
would
have
known
if
there
was
anything
wrong
with
these
delectable
little
morsels
Ernie
relaxed
So
this
place
isn
t
an
alien
trap
or
anything
he
asked
Captain
Memory
Oh
no
it
s
a
trap
alright
the
Captain
said
unconcernedly
helping
himself
to
a
dish
of
something
with
custard
and
cherries
in
it
WHAT
But
the
food
s
okay
the
Captain
continued
So
we
might
as
well
have
some
don
t
you
think
He
helped
himself
to
a
coconut
cream
pie
Ernie
suddenly
felt
very
anxious
So
uh
where
s
the
trap
then
Oh
I
don
t
know
the
Captain
went
on
We
ll
find
it
though
We
always
do
He
looked
at
Ernie
s
plate
Say
are
you
gonna
eat
that
Black
Forest
Torte
If
you
don
t
want
it
I
ll
take
it
Ernie
seemed
to
have
lost
his
appetite
Uh
here
Take
it
He
handed
the
dish
to
Captain
Memory
Ernie
s
stomach
was
beginning
to
feel
queasy
again
Stress
he
thought
It
s
not
good
for
me
I
m
gonna
get
an
ulcer
I
just
know
it
Ernie
noticed
an
open
door
in
the
back
of
the
cottage
It
seemed
to
lead
to
a
bathroom
Maybe
I
can
get
cleaned
up
Ernie
thought
The
dust
was
beginning
to
make
him
itch
Inside
the
door
Ernie
found
a
nicely
appointed
modern
bathroom
complete
with
soap
and
fresh
towels
I
ll
bet
I
have
time
for
a
quick
shower
he
thought
He
turned
on
the
shower
and
let
the
water
run
for
a
bit
Nice
and
warm
he
thought
Not
too
hot
Seems
okay
He
took
off
his
toreador
suit
shaking
the
dust
off
each
piece
in
turn
and
got
in
the
shower
Ernie
let
the
warn
water
run
over
him
Well
this
is
much
better
he
thought
relaxing
There
was
a
bottle
of
shampoo
on
the
tub
shelf
He
picked
it
up
and
examined
it
Placental
Protein
Shampoo
Oh
That
was
the
same
kind
of
shampoo
he
used
at
home
Maybe
it
would
get
the
dust
out
of
his
hair
Watch
ouph
phrm
trmp
What
Was
somebody
talking
to
him
Ernie
couldn
t
hear
over
the
sound
of
the
shower
He
stuck
his
head
out
Did
you
say
something
he
called
towards
the
others
Yes
answered
Captain
Memory
I
said
Watch
out
for
the
trap
WHAT
Ernie
leaped
out
of
the
shower
He
was
about
to
run
into
the
next
room
when
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
stark
naked
and
dripping
wet
He
decided
to
take
a
moment
to
grab
a
towel
and
wrap
it
around
himself
he
wasn
t
prepared
to
face
the
ridicule
he
would
have
gotten
otherwise
What
trap
Where
s
the
trap
You
re
holding
it
Captain
Memory
gestured
at
Ernie
The
TOWEL
Ernie
almost
flung
it
away
but
decided
against
it
No
your
other
hand
Ernie
looked
at
his
left
hand
He
was
still
unconsciously
clutching
the
bottle
of
shampoo
This
This
bottle
of
shampoo
Ernie
examined
it
What
is
it
a
bomb
or
something
No
it
s
a
bottle
of
shampoo
Captain
Memory
agreed
So
what
s
the
big
deal
Ernie
felt
a
little
foolish
getting
all
upset
over
a
bottle
of
shampoo
What
kind
of
shampoo
is
it
Captain
Memory
prompted
Placental
Protein
Shampoo
What
s
wrong
with
that
Do
you
know
what
a
placenta
is
Yeah
It
s
the
thing
that
feeds
an
embryo
in
the
womb
Ernie
had
gotten
an
A
in
biology
and
was
proud
of
it
Ever
wonder
what
proteins
from
embryos
are
doing
in
your
shampoo
Uh
now
that
you
mention
it
that
does
seem
a
little
strange
Ernie
admitted
Ever
wonder
proteins
from
embryos
of
WHAT
the
Captain
prodded
Or
what
KIND
of
proteins
I
don
t
like
the
sound
of
this
Ernie
said
quietly
Captain
Memory
went
on
DNA
is
a
protein
you
know
Ernie
thought
a
moment
You
mean
DNA
like
in
genetic
material
like
basic
building
blocks
of
life
the
stuff
that
determines
what
every
kind
of
life
form
is
going
to
be
That
s
right
the
Captain
agreed
Now
what
do
you
suppose
would
happen
to
you
if
you
rubbed
alien
DNA
from
unborn
space
creatures
onto
your
scalp
where
it
could
seep
right
down
into
your
brain
Ernie
looked
at
the
bottle
of
shampoo
uneasily
You
mean
it
could
like
take
over
your
brain
Could
be
Captain
Memory
agreed
However
it
doesn
t
work
all
at
once
It
has
to
seep
in
little
by
little
The
more
you
wash
your
hair
the
worse
it
gets
Ernie
was
suddenly
glad
he
didn
t
wash
his
hair
too
often
He
thought
for
a
moment
So
people
who
wash
their
hair
a
lot
would
get
it
the
worst
right
You
got
it
Captain
Memory
assented
cheerfully
Ernie
considered
the
problem
So
who
washes
their
hair
the
most
Pretty
girls
the
Fly
chimed
in
They
wash
their
hair
every
day
sometimes
more
than
once
I
know
cause
every
time
I
ask
one
out
one
she
says
I
can
t
go
today
I
gotta
wash
my
hair
That
s
true
Ernie
admitted
He
thought
a
moment
Wait
a
minute
We
have
this
stuff
at
home
In
fact
my
girlfriend
uses
it
The
Captain
considered
this
Noticed
any
changes
in
her
recently
Well
she
has
been
kind
of
cold
Ernie
conceded
And
now
that
you
mention
it
I
have
noticed
her
skin
getting
kind
of
scaly
but
I
thought
it
was
just
the
heartbreak
of
psoriasis
I
tried
to
say
something
about
it
but
she
hissed
at
me
Mmm
hmm
Captain
Memory
agreed
Y
know
I
noticed
that
a
lot
too
the
Fly
added
I
m
real
observant
and
I
noticed
that
an
awful
lot
of
pretty
girls
nowadays
have
forked
tongues
Ernie
frowned
He
had
noticed
something
odd
about
his
girlfriend
s
tongue
but
he
hadn
t
wanted
to
mention
it
He
didn
t
want
to
get
hissed
at
again
They
also
have
real
sharp
teeth
the
Fly
continued
And
slit
pupils
in
their
eyes
I
don
t
think
that
s
normal
do
you
All
of
this
was
making
Ernie
very
unhappy
You
mean
aliens
are
trying
to
take
over
the
Earth
he
asked
I
wouldn
t
doubt
it
Captain
Memory
answered
cheerfully
Well
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
cried
Ernie
Oh
you
don
t
need
to
worry
about
it
said
the
Captain
reassuringly
Why
not
asked
Ernie
suspiciously
It
s
just
a
game
anyway
right
The
Captain
gave
Ernie
a
cheery
smile
and
helped
himself
to
a
piece
of
lemon
meringue
pie
There
is
one
thing
you
could
do
Sterno
added
What
asked
Ernie
desperately
You
could
put
some
clothes
on
Sterno
said
looking
ruefully
at
the
peach
frappe
on
his
plate
The
sight
of
all
that
naked
skin
is
rather
spoiling
my
appetite
Oh
all
right
Ernie
snapped
stomping
off
to
the
bathroom
Sterno
sighed
Some
people
are
so
sensitive
he
commented
reaching
for
a
large
Cherries
Jubilee
Ernie
was
somewhat
placated
to
find
that
the
luster
had
returned
to
his
toreador
suit
The
only
thing
worse
than
having
to
go
around
in
a
toreador
outfit
was
having
to
go
around
in
a
DIRTY
toreador
outfit
He
returned
to
the
main
room
The
Fly
was
eating
what
seemed
to
be
large
cookies
of
some
kind
Hey
these
are
good
gingerbread
men
he
remarked
offering
one
to
Ernie
Ernie
examined
the
cookie
It
s
not
a
man
he
said
thoughtfully
It
looks
like
a
gingerbread
reptile
The
Fly
looked
at
the
cookies
Yeah
you
re
right
He
vacuumed
another
one
up
through
his
snout
They
re
good
though
Ernie
looked
at
the
cookie
ruefully
I
don
t
know
if
I
want
to
eat
a
reptile
Might
as
well
Captain
Memory
volunteered
It
wouldn
t
hesitate
to
eat
you
Ernie
put
the
cookie
down
quickly
He
seemed
to
have
lost
his
appetite
again
Ernie
heard
footsteps
approaching
the
house
A
man
in
a
post
office
uniform
carrying
a
bag
of
mail
was
coming
up
the
walk
Howdy
the
mailman
said
cheerfully
Nice
day
isn
t
it
Uh
yeah
Ernie
thought
he
should
be
the
one
to
answer
since
everyone
else
had
their
mouths
full
The
mailman
chatted
on
cheerily
Had
a
few
Nazis
a
mite
earlier
but
it
looks
like
it
cleared
up
He
looked
through
his
mail
Is
there
a
Mr
Ernest
Ross
here
Uh
that
s
me
Ernie
answered
unenthusiastically
Here
you
go
The
mailman
handed
Ernie
a
letter
Have
a
nice
day
He
left
Ernie
opened
the
letter
and
read
Dear

Ross

Ernie
looked
between
the
pages
There
was
no
enclosed
envelope
He
read
on
Sincerely

National
Bank
of
the
West
P
S

financial
difficulties

the
moment
please

little
as

trillion
dollars
a
month

care
of
this
account
Thank
you
Ernie
sighed
Isn
t
there
anywhere
you
can
go
to
get
away
from
junk
mail
I
doubt
it
answered
Captain
Memory
cutting
himself
a
big
slice
of
pineapple
upside
down
cake
Ernie
sighed
and
sat
down
on
the
nearest
piece
of
furniture
which
happened
to
be
a
child
s
rocking
chair
which
was
a
bit
too
small
for
him
Ernie
noticed
while
squeezing
himself
into
