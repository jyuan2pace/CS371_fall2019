anyway
Von
Liederkranz
smiled
evilly
You
ll
find
out
soon
enough
Ernie
looked
on
ahead
They
appeared
to
be
approaching
something
Oh
it
s
a
town
said
the
Fly
Vot
von
Liederkranz
snapped
Dere
s
not
supposed
to
be
a
town
here
Whoa
He
stopped
the
chariot
Vhere
s
my
map
He
pulled
out
a
map
and
began
regarding
it
carefully
Ah
here
s
de
problem
Ve
get
on
ze
autobahn
und
turn
left
at
Heidelberg
The
other
Romans
had
removed
their
togas
as
well
and
stood
revealed
as
Nazi
SS
troopers
One
of
them
peered
over
von
Liederkranz
s
shoulder
Uh
Herr
Sturmbannfuhrer
he
began
tentatively
Dat
s
a
map
of
Bavaria
Von
Liederkranz
started
He
looked
at
the
legend
of
the
map
and
then
crumpled
it
up
angrily
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
I
know
dat
he
snapped
I
vas
chust
testing
you
Very
good
He
prodded
the
SS
trooper
with
his
riding
crop
Okay
Mr
Know

all
vhere
do
ve
go
now
The
trooper
regarded
the
road
carefully
Vell
since
dere
s
only
one
road
and
dis
isn
t
de
right
vay
I
vould
say
ve

way
Von
Liederkranz
thought
a
minute
Uh
right
De
other
vay
Ve
go
de
other
vay
He
wheeled
the
chariot
around
and
they
galloped
off
in
the
other
direction
They
charged
on
down
the
yellow
brick
road
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
in
the
first
place
moving
faster
this
time
as
von
Liederkranz
whipped
the
horses
bad
temperedly
After
some
time
they
began
to
approach
what
seemed
to
be
a
town
Oh
wow
said
the
Fly
It
s
the
same
town
How
did
we
get
to
the
same
place
when
we
went
the
opposite
direction
I
told
you
so
smirked
Sterno
All
Roads
Lead
to
Rome
You
re
just
going
to
have
to
go
there
There
s
just
no
getting
out
of
it
Von
Liederkranz
peered
ahead
Gottverdammter
Vhere
s
my
map
He
pulled
out
another
map
and
regarded
it
carefully
Ah
Here
s
ze
problem
Ve
chust
get
on
I
turn
right
at
Indianapolis
The
SS
trooper
looked
over
von
Liederkranz
s
shoulder
again
Uh
Herr
Sturmbannfuhrer
dat
s
a
map
of
Illinois
Von
Liederkranz
started
He
quickly
crumpled
up
the
map
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
I
know
dat
He
turned
to
the
rest
of
the
group
Ve
are
going
to
zis
town
Ve
intended
to
go
to
zis
town
It
vas
NOT
a
mistake
They
continued
down
the
road
and
into
town
The
town
consisted
of
one
unpaved
road
flanked
by
one
story
wooden
buildings
with
broad
fronts
Their
names
were
clearly
legible
on
them
SALOON
GENERAL
STORE
U
S
MARSHAL
The
town
looked
somehow
familiar
to
Ernie
Oh
wow
exclaimed
the
Fly
It
s
Dodge
City
That
s
impossible
snorted
Sterno
You
can
t
have
All
Roads
Lead
to
Dodge
City
That
s
not
right
I
have
a
classical
education
and
I
know
Could
be
Abilene
I
suppose
mused
Ernie
All
Roads
Lead
to
Abilene
said
Sterno
sarcastically
Fat
chance
You
must
be
right
Ernie
agreed
I
don
t
see
any
cattle
around
Must
be
Dodge
City
after
all
As
they
passed
through
town
Ernie
noticed
a
tall
thin
young
man
who
looked
at
them
with
alarm
The
young
man
began
hurrying
towards
the
U
S
Marshal
s
office
walking
with
a
pronounced
limp
Mr
Dillon
Mr
Dillon
Somethin
strange
comin
into
town
he
cried
A
tall
imposing
man
dressed
in
Western
attire
and
wearing
a
U
S
Marshal
badge
stepped
out
of
the
marshal
s
office
and
into
the
street
blocking
the
path
of
the
chariot
Hold
up
there
now
What
do
you
boys
want
in
our
town
Get
out
of
my
vay
hissed
von
Liederkranz
I
haff
no
time
for
dis
shtupidity
Now
hold
on
just
a
minute
there
the
Marshal
began
Idiot
snapped
von
Liederkranz
He
turned
to
the
SS
troopers
Disintegrate
him
von
Liederkranz
and
the
SS
troopers
reached
for
their
evil
looking
weapons
With
lightning
speed
the
Marshal
s
gun
flew
into
his
hand
Four
shots
rand
out
catching
each
of
the
Nazis
full
in
the
chest
the
force
of
the
bullet
hurling
their
bodies
from
the
chariot
I
seen
it
Mr
Dillon
cried
Chester
the
young
man
with
the
limp
They
drew
first
Ernie
threw
his
hands
up
over
his
head
Don
t
shoot
We
re
unarmed
Sterno
get
down
on
all
fours
Woof
he
said
emphatically
They
don
t
shoot
dogs
do
they
They
were
holding
us
prisoner
the
Fly
chimed
in
They
shot
Ben
Hur
Ben
who
The
Marshal
looked
confused
Just
then
a
woman
in
an
elaborate
red
dress
ran
out
of
the
saloon
Oh
Matt
Are
you
all
right
I
heard
the
shooting
Don
t
you
worry
Miss
Kitty
I
m
just
fine
the
Marshal
reassured
her
Ernie
looked
at
the
ground
behind
him
The
bloody
bodies
of
von
Liederkranz
and
the
other
Nazis
were
lying
motionless
in
the
dust
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Are
they
really
dead
Oh
yes
said
Captain
Memory
cheerfully
Too
bad
they
won
t
stay
that
way
Huh
Ernie
was
confused
Well
you
know
how
it
is
in
computer
games
the
Captain
went
on
If
you
get
killed
you
just
start
over
again
with
another
life
I
dunno
they
looked
pretty
dead
to
me
Ernie
said
Look
again
the
Captain
advised
Ernie
turned
The
bodies
had
vanished
See
the
Captain
said
They
ve
gone
back
to
the
beginning
They
ll
have
to
start
all
over
Ernie
turned
back
to
look
at
the
Marshal
who
had
been
conferring
with
Miss
Kitty
and
Chester
You
boys
are
free
to
go
the
Marshal
said
Just
stay
out
of
trouble
He
went
back
into
his
office
Whew
the
Fly
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Boy
are
we
lucky
to
get
out
of
that
one
You
don
t
want
to
mess
with
Marshal
Dillon
Sterno
stood
back
up
and
brushed
himself
off
trying
to
recover
his
lost
dignity
You
can
put
your
hands
down
now
he
said
to
Ernie
snappishly
You
have
no
idea
how
ridiculous
you
look
surrendering
when
there
s
no
one
there
Oh
Ernie
lowered
his
hands
He
looked
around
So
what
are
we
gonna
do
in
Dodge
City
The
Fly
looked
at
the
Saloon
Look
at
all
those
pretty
girls
in
there
Whaddya
say
we
go
in
for
a
drink
Well
okay
Ernie
couldn
t
think
of
any
reason
not
to
Besides
his
throat
was
feeling
pretty
dusty
after
that
long
chariot
ride
They
got
out
of
the
chariot
and
walked
towards
the
saloon
the
Fly
leading
the
way
They
walked
up
to
the
doors
when
suddenly
their
way
was
blocked
by
a
burly
bartender
Hold
it
right
there
boys
We
don
t
allow
no
Injuns
in
here
Huh
The
Fly
was
confused
That
means
you
The
bartender
prodded
the
Fly
in
the
chest
Imagine
that
trying
to
come
in
here
with
feathers
he
gestured
toward
the
Fly
s
antenna
and
a
war
mask
He
gestured
towards
the
Fly
s
face
The
dance
hall
girls
laughed
derisively
Hey
wait
a
minute
the
Fly
protested
I
m
not
A
shotgun
suddenly
appeared
in
the
bartender
s
hands
I
said
Git
he
said
menacingly
NOW
Okay
okay
the
Fly
backed
off
I
m
gittin
And
don
t
come
back
the
bartender
called
after
them
The
Fly
sighed
as
the
foursome
walked
back
to
the
chariot
Aw
gee
I
never
get
to
have
any
fun
CHAPTER
The
foursome
walked
slowly
back
towards
Ben
Hur
s
chariot
Suddenly
the
lead
horse
reared
up
whinnying
loudly
and
the
four
horses
galloped
out
of
town
as
fast
as
they
could
run
the
empty
chariot
bouncing
along
behind
them
Ernie
was
totally
taken
aback
by
this
Hey
they
started
up
all
by
themselves
he
said
as
the
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
the
horse
s
hooves
drifted
over
them
Can
they
do
that
Well
obviously
they
can
Sterno
sneered
And
it
s
all
your
fault
MY
fault
Ernie
coughed
Why
is
it
MY
fault
Because
it
s
always
your
fault
Sterno
snapped
YOU
didn
t
tie
them
up
Me
Ernie
protested
I
didn
t
know
you
had
to
tie
them
up
Can
t
you
just
like
turn
them
off
or
something
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
Hopeless
Captain
Memory
looked
up
at
the
bright
afternoon
sun
Nice
day
for
a
walk
don
t
you
think
Ernie
looked
down
the
road
It
seemed
to
stretch
endlessly
through
a
scrubby
dusty
semi
desert
landscape
It
looked
exactly
like
the
scenery
he
d
seen
in
hundreds
of
episodes
of
Gunsmoke
It
did
not
look
like
a
pleasant
place
for
a
walk
Maybe
we
could
just
stay
here
he
suggested
hopefully
Just
then
Marshal
Dillon
stepped
out
of
his
office
You
boys
better
get
movin
before
you
get
into
more
trouble
he
said
sternly
I
want
you
out
of
town
before
sunset
Ernie
sighed
Well
okay
maybe
we
won
t
stay
here
then
The
foursome
started
off
down
the
road
occasionally
glancing
over
their
shoulders
to
see
if
the
Marshal
was
still
watching
them
Unfortunately
he
was
After
what
seemed
like
hours
they
approached
a
fork
in
the
road
One
branch
seemed
to
head
off
into
the
mountains
and
another
into
the
valley
They
stopped
Ernie
looked
at
both
branches
of
the
road
Well
which
way
do
we
go
The
high
road
or
the
low
road
I
know
the
Fly
chimed
in
brightly
You
take
the
high
road
and
I
ll
take
the
low
road
Why
Because
then
I
ll
be
in
Scotland
afore
ye
The
Fly
beamed
Gimme
a
break
moaned
Ernie
Wait
a
minute
Captain
Memory
interrupted
What
Maybe
the
Captain
could
come
up
with
something
that
would
get
them
out
of
this
desolate
landscape
Isn
t
it
supposed
to
be
you
ll
take
the
low
road
and
I
ll
take
the
high
road
The
Fly
frowned
No
I
m
sure
it
s
supposed
to
be
you
take
the
high
road
and
I
ll
take
the
low
road
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
No
I
think
it
s
the
other
way
around
No
it
can
t
be
the
Fly
answered
Listen
He
started
to
sing
You
ll
take
the
high
road
That
s
enough
already
Sterno
broke
in
What
difference
does
it
make
anyway
We
re
not
going
to
Scotland
Ernie
looked
around
Okay
then
where
are
we
going
Rome
stated
Sterno
confidently
All
Roads
Lead
to
Rome
Ernie
regarded
the
landscape
skeptically
I
dunno
Rome
that
s
in
Italy
right
This
doesn
t
look
like
Italy
to
me
It
looks
like
He
stopped
Like
what
Sterno
demanded
Like
well
well
I
don
t
know
what
it
looks
like
but
it
doesn
t
look
like
Italy
It
s
pointless
to
argue
with
me
said
Sterno
pompously
Because
I
have
a
classical
education
and
I
am
therefore
always
right
Aren
t
there
supposed
to
be
like
grapes
and
pizzas
and
people
playing
those
little
accordions
Ernie
wondered
No
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
The
Fly
looked
down
the
road
into
the
valley
and
up
the
road
into
the
mountains
Okay
so
which
way
do
we
go
then
It
doesn
t
matter
said
Sterno
self
importantly
All
Roads
Lead
to
Rome
The
Fly
started
up
the
road
into
the
mountains
You
guys
can
go
any
way
you
want
he
called
back
over
his
shoulder
But
I
m
going
this
way
Why
Ernie
called
after
him
Cause
then
I
ll
be
in
Scotland
afore
ye
The
Fly
laughed
and
started
running
Last
one
there
is
a
rotten
egg
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
and
Sterno
Well
he
said
at
last
I
guess
we
might
as
well
follow
him
I
ll
say
Captain
Memory
agreed
I
wouldn
t
want
him
to
be
in
Scotland
afore
me
The
three
of
them
turned
and
began
walking
up
the
road
into
the
mountains
The
road
headed
upward
at
a
moderate
angle
making
walking
somewhat
difficult
They
began
to
notice
the
terrain
around
them
changing
as
they
walked
They
seemed
to
be
moving
into
a
cooler
moister
environment
The
desert
was
giving
way
to
cool
Alpine
meadows
The
road
narrowed
into
a
path
threading
it
s
way
between
the
growing
hills
Actually
Ernie
thought
It
s
kind
of
nice
here
Maybe
taking
the
high
road
was
a
good
idea
They
had
not
seen
the
Fly
for
quite
some
time
but
they
were
fairly
confident
that
he
was
just
a
bit
out
of
sight
ahead
of
them
since
they
could
hear
someone
singing
I
ll
take
the
high
road
in
the
distance
Suddenly
the
singing
stopped
Ernie
frowned
He
hoped
the
Fly
hadn
t
fallen
over
a
cliff
or
something
He
strained
his
ears
No
no
singing
Suddenly
he
heard
another
sound
Did
you
hear
that
he
said
to
Sterno
Of
course
said
Sterno
assuredly
Ernie
frowned
What
did
that
sound
like
to
you
I
believe
it
was
Yodellay
he
hoo
Sterno
replied
Ernie
knitted
his
brow
in
concentration
I
ve
heard
that
before
That
reminds
me
of
something
Like
what
asked
Sterno
with
a
slight
air
of
sarcasm
Fondue
perhaps
Chocolate
Watches
Heidi
Ernie
brightened
Switzerland
We
re
in
Switzerland
Very
good
applauded
Sterno
Go
to
the
head
of
the
class
Ernie
frowned
again
So
what
are
we
doing
in
Switzerland
Captain
Memory
shrugged
We
seem
to
have
wandered
into
somebody
s
Geography
program
So
now
what
We
go
on
to
Rome
of
course
Sterno
answered
confidently
Ernie
looked
at
the
rising
mountains
and
Alpine
meadows
around
them
Are
you
sure
we
re
going
the
right
way
I
mean
are
we
supposed
to
go
through
Switzerland
to
get
to
Rome
Of
course
said
Sterno
with
great
assurance
Don
t
you
remember
Hannibal
taking
his
elephants
through
the
Alps
on
his
way
to
Rome
Hannibal
Ernie
s
face
lit
up
with
recognition
I
saw
that
movie
Starring
Victor
Mature
right
Ernie
looked
at
the
narrow
path
on
which
they
stood
and
frowned
What
are
we
gonna
do
if
we
run
into
an
elephant
on
this
trail
At
that
moment
they
turned
a
corner
and
came
upon
the
Fly
who
was
standing
still
looking
at
something
Hi
guys
he
said
Take
a
look
at
this
The
trail
at
this
pointed
rounded
a
curve
at
the
top
of
a
cliff
The
Fly
pointed
over
the
side
into
the
valley
below
There
was
some
sort
of
commotion
going
on
in
the
valley
There
seemed
to
be
a
large
crowd
of
some
sort
moving
through
the
valley
carrying
torches
Ernie
peered
into
the
valley
There
were
a
lot
of
people
or
animals
or
something
moving
around
but
he
couldn
t
make
out
what
they
were
doing
Another
cattle
drive
he
suggested
I
doubt
it
remarked
Sterno
Look
at
all
those
torches
Must
be
a
torch
drive
the
Fly
said
brightly
Sterno
glared
at
the
Fly
and
muttered
something
unintelligible
Those
torches
sure
are
pretty
aren
t
they
commented
Captain
Memory
Maybe
we
should
go
down
and
join
the
party
Ernie
could
hear
some
kind
of
chanting
drifting
up
from
the
valley
He
strained
to
hear
what
they
were
saying
It
seemed
to
be
something
like
Oom
alla
boom
He
frowned
Somehow
he
just
didn
t
like
the
look
of
that
crowd
Uh
maybe
we
d
better
not
he
countered
Sterno
agreed
with
him
Maybe
another
time
the
dog
suggested
Captain
Memory
looked
at
the
others
You
guys
are
no
fun
he
complained
The
foursome
watched
the
commotion
below
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
continued
along
the
trail
The
narrow
trail
wound
along
between
huge
boulders
making
it
impossible
to
see
very
far
ahead
The
foursome
passed
through
a
narrow
opening
and
found
themselves
facing
a
large
open
field
which
seemed
to
stretch
on
for
miles
In
the
middle
of
this
space
was
a
large
English
style
mansion
surrounded
by
carefully
tended
grounds
The
foursome
approached
it
A
low
ornamental
fence
surrounded
the
grounds
A
road
led
through
the
fence
and
up
to
the
front
door
Lacking
any
better
ideas
the
foursome
walked
down
the
road
and
up
to
the
front
door
The
door
was
massive
and
imposing
with
a
huge
cast
iron
door
knocker
in
the
middle
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
Captain
Memory
looked
at
the
Fly
The
Fly
looked
at
Sterno
Sterno
looked
at
Ernie
Ernie
looked
around
Everyone
was
looking
at
him
Ernie
sighed
and
stepped
up
to
the
door
Tentatively
he
raised
the
knocker
and
let
it
drop
It
made
a
surprisingly
loud
sound
Ernie
flinched
He
waited
Nothing
happened
Try
it
again
Sterno
demanded
Ernie
frowned
Why
don
t
you
try
it
He
had
a
bad
feeling
about
this
place
It
looked
like
someplace
he
had
seen
in
a
movie
sometime
He
didn
t
remember
what
movie
it
was
or
what
happened
but
it
was
something
bad
Well
obviously
I
m
not
tall
enough
to
reach
it
said
Sterno
patronizingly
Anyway
it
s
your
job
Why
is
it
my
job
cried
Ernie
indignantly
Why
is
it
always
my
job
You
started
it
retorted
Sterno
Ernie
sighed
He
knew
there
would
be
some
reason
why
it
was
his
job
He
always
got
stuck
with
things
like
this
Who
knows
what
kind
of
horrible
creature
would
answer
the
door
Even
if
it
was
a
normal
person
what
was
he
supposed
to
say
to
them
anyway
Oh
well
might
as
well
get
it
over
with
He
raised
the
knocker
and
slammed
it
down
several
times
raising
a
tremendous
din
that
no
one
in
the
house
could
have
missed
They
waited
Nothing
happened
Well
nobody
s
home
said
Ernie
lightly
I
guess
we
might
as
well
go
Oh
come
ON
snapped
Sterno
irritatedly
Where
are
we
supposed
to
go
anyway
Try
the
doorknob
Ernie
shifted
the
coffee
maker
to
his
other
hand
and
gingerly
touched
the
huge
cast
iron
doorknob
half
expecting
an
explosion
or
an
electric
shock
Nothing
happened
He
tried
to
turn
it
It
was
very
securely
locked
and
totally
unmovable
Well
door
s
locked
said
Ernie
in
a
cheerful
tone
Might
as
well
go
We
ll
find
another
way
in
said
Sterno
sternly
Let
s
walk
around
the
building
Ernie
grimaced
The
others
however
seemed
content
to
follow
Sterno
as
he
headed
off
around
the
corner
to
the
left
Ernie
supposed
there
was
no
way
to
get
out
of
this
so
he
followed
as
well
bringing
up
the
rear
A
small
garden
path
led
around
the
corner
of
the
building
through
the
English
garden
and
to
a
nicely
tended
stone
patio
French
doors
led
from
the
house
to
the
patio
Just
as
I
thought
Sterno
declared
He
strode
purposefully
up
to
the
doors
and
tried
the
knob
They
were
unlocked
He
led
the
way
into
the
house
They
found
themselves
in
a
luxurious
English
style
study
the
walls
panelled
with
dark
oak
and
lined
with
shelves
containing
leather
bound
books
Sterno
headed
immediately
for
a
small
occasional
table
by
the
wall
Aha
he
cried
I
knew
it
He
flipped
open
a
dark
wood
box
revealing
a
store
of
excellent
cigars
He
grabbed
a
handful
of
them
lighting
one
immediately
Ahhh
He
exhaled
a
cloud
of
blue
smoke
His
eyes
lit
upon
a
decanter
sitting
next
to
the
humidor
Lovely
he
exclaimed
Brandy
anyone
Ernie
sighed
wearily
All
this
stress
was
just
too
much
for
him
he
decided
Luckily
there
was
a
large
overstuffed
Victorian
sofa
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
room
Ernie
dropped
heavily
onto
it
followed
by
Captain
Memory
and
the
Fly
Captain
Memory
scanned
the
room
slowly
I
wonder
where
they
keep
their
TV
he
said
pensively
The
sofa
faced
to
large
oak
doors
which
Ernie
supposed
must
lead
to
the
rest
of
the
house
Ernie
considered
them
wondering
if
they
should
try
to
explore
the
house
further
No
he
decided
let
s
just
leave
well
enough
alone
At
that
moment
the
doors
flew
open
In
the
doorway
stood
a
tall
very
British
looking
gentleman
with
a
white
handlebar
mustache
wearing
a
smoking
jacket
and
a
top
hat
How
good
of
you
to
come
he
announced
jovially
I
m
Lord
Foofaraw
Do
make
yourselves
at
home
Tea
anyone
A
butler
entered
carrying
a
silver
tray
full
of
teacups
and
three
large
covered
silver
dishes
Ernie
gratefully
accepted
a
cup
of
tea
and
peeked
under
the
covers
of
the
dishes
The
first
two
contained
unappetizing
looking
little
ornamental
sandwiches
They
seemed
to
be
made
of
plastic
or
some
other
not
entirely
edible
material
At
this
point
however
Ernie
was
so
ravenously
hungry
he
would
have
eaten
practically
anything
even
items
that
were
only
marginally
edible
However
Ernie
decided
to
check
the
third
dish
What
luck
It
contained
a
large
pile
of
fresh
hot
sizzling
lamb
chops
broiled
to
perfection
Ernie
loved
lamb
chops
He
grabbed
the
entire
dish
off
the
tray
and
began
wolfing
them
down
eating
them
with
his
bare
hands
As
Ernie
s
hunger
subsided
he
began
to
feel
self
conscious
They
seemed
to
be
having
an
elegant
English
tea
with
a
titled
British
nobleman
and
here
he
was
wearing
a
fur
loincloth
carrying
a
plastic
broadsword
and
a
coffee
maker
and
eating
lamb
chops
with
his
bare
hands
It
didn
t
seem
proper
to
Ernie
Certainly
it
was
very
un
British
Ernie
frowned
Then
on
the
other
hand
it
wasn
t
his
fault
Lord
Foofaraw
was
the
one
who
served
the
lamb
chops
They
shouldn
t
serve
lamb
chops
if
they
don
t
want
people
to
eat
them
And
anyway
they
didn
t
give
him
any
utensils
so
he
had
to
eat
them
with
his
hands
That
settled
Ernie
returned
to
stuffing
his
face
with
chops
Pip
pip
Cheerio
Eh
wot
said
Lord
Foofaraw
jovially
How
very
British
exclaimed
Sterno
delightedly
Rather
agreed
Lord
Foofaraw
Ernie
turned
to
the
nobleman
I
wonder
if
you
could
tell
us
where
we
are
he
managed
to
ask
between
bites
Where
you
ARE
Lord
Foofaraw
seemed
amazed
Why
I
should
think
that
would
be
quite
obvious
You
re
HERE
old
boy
Sterno
chuckled
The
Fly
waved
his
antennae
confusedly
Captain
Memory
continued
to
look
around
for
a
TV
Lord
Foofaraw
settled
comfortably
into
an
overstuffed
chair
Ah
yes
he
began
This
reminds
me
of
the
time
I
was
lost
in
the
jungles
of
Poodawumpus
surrounded
by
cannibals
He
leaned
forward
animatedly
There
were
cannibals
to
the
right
of
me
cannibals
to
the
left
of
me
The
light
of
their
torches
flickered
through
the
dense
undergrowth
I
could
hear
their
infernal
chanting
Oom
alla
boom
Oom
alla
boom
Over
and
over
until
I
thought
the
infernal
din
should
surely
drive
me
mad
Suddenly
I
He
broke
off
looking
at
Ernie
oddly
I
say
my
good
man
why
ever
are
you
carrying
that
coffee
maker
Ernie
fidgeted
uncomfortably
It
s
not
a
coffee
maker
it
s
a
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
A
WOT
the
lord
was
amazed
A
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
Ernie
repeated
Lord
Foofaraw
looked
at
him
skeptically
Ernie
looked
again
at
the
device
he
was
carrying
He
sighed
On
the
other
hand
it
could
be
a
coffee
maker
too
I
suppose
Ernie
admitted
Anyway
it
s
genuine
Bakelite
Ah
yes
Bakelite
the
lord
seemed
to
consider
this
answer
reasonable
A
faraway
look
came
into
his
eyes
That
reminds
me
of
the
time
I
was
trekking
through
the
desert
of
Duzzlebuggy
But
what
about
the
cannibals
the
Fly
broke
in
his
antennae
waving
excitedly
Don
t
interrupt
His
Lordship
snapped
Sterno
Lord
Foofaraw
looked
confused
I
say
old
man
there
are
no
cannibals
in
the
deserts
of
Duzzlebuggy
The
Fly
s
antennae
drooped
disappointedly
I
wanted
to
hear
about
the
cannibals
Oh
dear
The
lord
seemed
quite
flustered
by
all
these
interruptions
Where
was
I
Ah
yes
there
I
was
scaling
the
mountains
of
Muffiedump
Ernie
s
mind
wandered
He
noticed
a
beautiful
silver
bell
sitting
on
an
end
table
next
to
him
It
seemed
to
be
a
very
unusual
design
It
was
covered
with
dozens
of
tiny
pushbuttons
each
with
an
odd
little
symbol
next
to
it
Ernie
picked
it
up
curiously
BONG
BONG
Loud
synthesized
bell
sounds
appeared
as
though
out
of
nowhere
Lord
Foofaraw
looked
up
in
annoyance
stopping
his
story
in
mid
sentence
I
say
my
good
man
Whatever
ARE
you
doing
Ernie
looked
up
disconcertedly
I
um
it
The
bell
continued
to
bong
loudly
How
RUDE
Sterno
glared
at
Ernie
Ernie
examined
the
bell
frantically
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
turn
it
off
He
could
see
now
that
is
wasn
t
a
real
bell
but
rather
an
electronic
synthesized
bell
with
orchestral
sounds
a
rhythm
machine
and
full
MIDI
capability
Ernie
pushed
the
tiny
buttons
frenziedly
desperately
trying
to
turn
the
thing
off
The
sound
changed
Chick
a
Boom
Chick
a
BOOM
Ernie
had
accidentally
turned
on
the
rhythm
machine
The
door
to
the
study
opened
The
Butler
entered
a
swarthy
character
who
looked
somehow
familiar
to
Ernie
The
sound
abruptly
stopped
Ernie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
The
Butler
looked
at
Ernie
and
then
at
Lord
Foofaraw
Chu
rang
he
enquired
Ah
yes
Lord
Foofaraw
seemed
to
have
regained
his
composure
More
tea
Richard
Chure
the
Butler
said
agreeably
and
began
refilling
their
cups
His
Lordship
resumed
his
story
and
there
I
was
surrounded
by
techno
savages
They
had
decided
to
sacrifice
a
virgin
but
the
first
one
they
selected
was
discovered
to
be
how
shall
I
say
damaged
so
they
were
obliged
to
move
on
to
the
next
who
became
Virgin
But
she
was
found
to
be
not
entirely
suitable
so
they
settled
upon
Virgin
revised
It
seemed
to
have
gotten
dark
outside
although
they
had
hardly
noticed
it
since
the
Butler
or
someone
had
turned
on
the
lights
That
was
odd
Ernie
thought
because
it
had
been
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
only
a
few
minutes
ago
He
was
going
to
consider
it
further
when
abruptly
the
lights
went
out
plunging
them
all
into
total
darkness
From
out
of
nowhere
a
gust
of
wind
blew
up
throwing
the
French
doors
open
violently
Suddenly
a
shot
rang
out
They
heard
a
cry
and
a
body
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
The
lights
came
on
again
There
in
the
middle
of
the
Persian
carpet
Lord
Foofaraw
lay
dead
in
a
pool
of
blood
Nearby
lay
a
smoking
gun
Ernie
was
stunned
Before
he
could
even
think
of
what
to
do
the
oak
doors
leading
to
the
rest
of
the
house
flew
open
and
a
man
in
a
trench
coat
and
a
fedora
strode
purposefully
in
Scotland
Yard
he
announced
No
one
leave
this
room
A
crowd
of
Bobbies
seemed
to
have
materialized
outside
of
both
sets
of
doors
Clearly
no
one
was
going
to
be
able
to
leave
this
room
until
the
detective
was
ready
to
allow
it
Ernie
frowned
This
was
beginning
to
remind
him
an
awful
lot
of
some
movie
or
other
although
he
still
couldn
t
remember
which
one
it
was
Oh
I
remember
this
Captain
Memory
exclaimed
delightedly
This
is
a
game
called
MYSTERY
you
know
one
of
those
who
dunnit
things
We
have
to
solve
the
mystery
The
captain
seemed
very
pleased
This
is
great
fun
The
detective
scanned
all
of
their
faces
carefully
So
here
we
all
are
at
last
he
said
At
last
Ernie
thought
Uh
we
only
just
got
here
Ernie
said
tentatively
wiping
his
greasy
hands
on
his
fur
loincloth
And
we
really
don
t
know
anything
about
this
so
if
you
don
t
mind
we
ll
just
be
on
our
He
started
to
get
up
Sit
DOWN
shouted
the
detective
No
one
leaves
until
I
say
so
Ernie
sat
He
hadn
t
really
thought
he
was
going
to
get
away
with
that
but
he
d
though
he
d
give
it
a
try
anyway
So
the
detective
continued
We
know
you
all
had
a
reason
for
wanting
Lord
Foofaraw
dead
The
foursome
all
looked
at
one
another
Ernie
shrugged
Captain
Memory
shrugged
The
Fly
shrugged
Sterno
shrugged
in
a
very
un
doglike
manner
Well
actually
Ernie
began
tentatively
No
I
A
likely
story
interrupted
the
detective
Here
you
are
wearing
a
fur
loincloth
and
a
plastic
broadsword
carrying
He
cocked
an
eye
quizzically
at
Ernie
a
coffee
maker
And
you
expect
me
to
believe
a
story
like
that
And
just
WHERE
did
you
get
that
bag
of
gold
anyway
Ernie
began
to
feel
very
self
conscious
He
decided
that
perhaps
he
had
better
keep
his
mouth
shut
It
didn
t
seem
to
him
that
saying
Attila
the
Hun
gave
it
to
me
would
go
over
very
well
And
what
about
those
LAMB
CHOPS
the
detective
thundered
Everyone
knows
that
one
never
serves
lamb
chops
for
tea
So
just
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
Ernie
shrank
down
into
his
seat
And
YOU
The
detective
jabbed
a
finger
at
the
Fly
who
flinched
You
blamed
Lord
Foofaraw
for
your
terrible
accident
didn
t
you
The
accident
that
left
you
horribly
disfigured
and
left
Lord
Foofaraw
free
to
start
an
affair
with
YOUR
WIFE
But
but
I
don
t
even
have
a
wife
The
Fly
began
his
antennae
waving
in
consternation
All
these
years
you
ve
plotted
revenge
haven
t
you
the
detective
continued
And
now
suddenly
mysteriously
Lord
Foofaraw
turns
up
DEAD
What
are
we
to
make
of
THAT
my
fine
Fly
friend
But
but
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
wildly
The
detective
however
had
already
gone
on
to
the
next
suspect
And
YOU
He
jabbed
a
finger
at
Sterno
You
ve
had
no
reward
for
years
of
faithful
service
have
you
You
ve
worked
like
a
dog
running
and
fetching
every
time
his
Lordship
snapped
his
fingers
We
know
how
you
resented
it
how
you
longed
to
even
the
score
Yet
year
after
year
you
let
his
Lordship
treat
you
like
an
animal
with
never
a
whimper
of
complaint
And
NOW
here
you
are
helping
yourself
to
his
Lordship
s
best
brandy
and
cigars
What
would
his
Lordship
have
thought
of
THAT
Sterno
thought
fast
Woof
he
answered
The
detective
however
had
already
gone
on
to
the
next
suspect
And
finally
the
detective
said
leaving
a
pregnant
pause
we
have
YOU
He
jabbed
a
finger
in
Captain
Memory
s
face
The
famous
Captain
Memory
Through
Space
and
Time
Without
a
Dime
I
think
you
ve
been
heard
to
say
Actually
I
sort
of
prefer
Through
Time
and
Space
to
a
Better
Place
answered
the
Captain
conversationally
A
likely
story
snapped
the
detective
We
know
what
you
ve
been
up
to
We
see
you
when
you
re
sleeping
We
know
if
you
re
awake
We
know
if
you
ve
been
bad
or
good
so
be
He
stopped
abruptly
glancing
suspiciously
about
him
Never
mind
The
question
here
is
just
exactly
how
do
you
JUMP
out
of
sectors
that
aren
t
supposed
to
accept
any
external
commands
anyway
Captain
Memory
frowned
What
does
that
have
to
do
with
Lord
Foofaraw
You
know
very
well
what
it
has
to
do
with
the
case
snapped
the
detective
Just
answer
the
question
Suddenly
a
light
went
on
in
Ernie
s
head
He
suddenly
remembered
how
all
the
pieces
fit
together
I
know
he
shouted
The
BUTLER
DID
IT
The
butler
blanched
Hey
mon
he
cried
out
What
chu
talkin
about
I
don
do
nothin
The
detective
looked
irritated
Don
t
change
the
subject
he
snapped
He
turned
back
to
Captain
Memory
Awright
youse
guys
Talk
Youse
guys
ain
t
gonna
play
me
for
a
patsy
Ernie
and
the
Fly
looked
at
each
other
in
confusion
The
detective
continued
You
lousy
two
bit
gunsels
think
you
can
take
a
rod
and
One
of
the
Bobbies
came
in
hurriedly
tapped
the
detective
on
the
shoulder
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
What
the
detective
snapped
He
laughed
nervously
Oh
Right
BRITISH
detective
He
laughed
again
Pip
pip
Cheerio
Eh
wot
Ernie
frowned
There
was
something
very
suspicious
about
this
detective
For
one
thing
his
large
British
style
handlebar
mustache
did
not
seem
to
be
attached
to
his
face
very
well
It
was
slowly
drooping
off
one
side
of
his
face
There
was
something
funny
about
his
clothes
too
The
trenchcoat
was
okay
the
hat
was
okay
Maybe
it
was
the
jackboots
Sterno
gave
the
detective
a
pitiless
glare
You
lost
your
character
he
accused
The
detective
laughed
nervously
Character
Vot
character
I
m
not
a
character
I
m
uh
He
looked
flustered
He
elbowed
the
bobby
next
to
him
Quick
he
whispered
Who
am
I
The
bobby
whispered
something
in
his
ear
The
detective
seemed
to
recover
his
composure
somewhat
Oh
yes
Of
course
I
m
the
famous
British
detective
Thomas
Cheddar
Sterno
s
fur
stood
on
end
Oh
no
It
s
cheese
CHEESE
RUN
he
wailed
But
it
was
too
late
The
detective
whipped
an
evil
looking
weapon
out
from
under
his
raincoat
which
parted
to
reveal
a
black
SS
uniform
beneath
it
Enough
of
zis
shtupidity
he
cried
holding
the
foursome
at
bay
You
vill
perhaps
recognize
me
now
he
said
confidently
He
screwed
a
monocle
into
one
eye
and
whipped
off
the
false
handlebar
mustache
with
a
flourish
He
immediately
regretted
this
and
winced
with
pain
as
the
glue
on
the
false
mustache
tore
out
half
the
hairs
of
his
real
mustache
He
quickly
regained
his
composure
however
and
waited
for
some
response
from
the
foursome
Captain
Memory
looked
at
Ernie
Ernie
shrugged
The
detective
looked
from
one
to
the
other
You
DO
recognize
me
ja
he
asked
a
bit
uncertainly
I
m
sure
we
ve
seen
you
someplace
before
said
Sterno
patronizingly
Of
course
agreed
Captain
Memory
It
s
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
It
s
uh
He
trailed
off
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
uncertainly
Suddenly
he
brightened
Oh
I
get
it
It
s
a
game
right
First
syllable
Sounds
like
He
began
gesticulating
wildly
I
know
I
know
It
s
Fred
Astaire
right
Fred
Astaire
Enough
the
detective
shouted
angrily
I
cannot
believe
dat
you
do
not
recognize
me

Sterno
continued
It

Von

Captain

agreeably
Why

Nein

shrieked
I

The
Fly
sulked
Why
do
you
always
get
to
ask
the
questions
How
come
we
never
get
to
ask
any
questions
Quite
right
Sterno
asserted
And
why
must
you
always
wear
that
dreadful
uniform
Von
Liederkranz
stopped
startled
Uniform
Vot
s
wrong

my

I

Sterno
sniffed
It
s
hardly
the
thing
for
High
Tea

it
I
should
think
a
top
hat
Puttink

a
top

von

asked
incredulously
White

Sterno
went
on
Puttink
on
a
white
tie
The
Nazi
seemed
amazed
PUTTING
ON
THE
RITZ
The
Fly
shouted
joyously
finishing
the
line
of
the
song
I
knew
it
I
knew
it
was
Fred
Astaire
Von
Liederkranz
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
Ja
I
DO
look
a
great
deal
like
your
Fred
Astaire
nein
Of
course
he
didn
t
look
anything
like
Fred
Astaire
but
no
one
wanted
to
be
the
one
to
tell
him
that
Oh
yes
Sterno
enthused
insincerely
You
ve
all
the
elegance
all
the
grace
of
the
greatest
dancer
of
all
time
Von
Liederkranz
preened
Ja
dat
s
right
I
do
Looking
down
he
noticed
Lord
Foofaraw
s
top
hat
which
had
rolled
off
his
head
when
he
collapsed
dead
He
picked
it
up
tossing
his
own
military
cap
aside
Using
Lord
Foofaraw
s
top
hat
and
his
own
riding
crop
as
a
cane
he
attempted
to
do
a
Fred
Astaire
style
top
hat
and
cane
number
He
began
to
do
a
few
awkward
shuffling
dance
steps
Puttink
on
mein
top
hat
he
began
to
sing
The
Bobbies
had
by
now
shed
their
English
policeman
uniforms
to
reveal
their
Nazi
uniforms
beneath
They
were
totally
confused
by
this
turn
of
events
They
shuffled
about
awkwardly
not
knowing
what
to
do
Von
Liederkranz
glared
at
them
Sing
he
commanded
The
Nazi
s
lined
up
and
formed
a
chorus
line
swaying
with
the
music
singing
off
key
puttink
on
mein
white
tie
Von
Liederkranz
attempted
to
do
some
slightly
more
complicated
steps
but
succeeded
only
in
knocking
over
the
silver
tray
sending
the
tea
cups
and
little
plastic
sandwiches
crashing
to
the
ground
This
threw
the
other
Nazi
s
off
their
rhythm
Half
of
them
swayed
left
and
half
swayed
right
causing
them
to
violently
bump
into
each
other
knocking
some
off
their
feet
Their
voices
trailed
off
Sing
von
Liederkranz
commanded
ferociously
The
Nazi
s
resumed
singing
with
feigned
enthusiasm
PUTTINK
ON
DER
RITZ
I
knew
it
the
Fly
enthused
I
knew
it
was
Fred
Astaire
That
means
I
win
right
Von
Liederkranz
and
the
Nazis
began
dancing
gracelessly
towards
the
door
that
led
to
the
hallway
singing
Dum
de
dum
de
dum
dum
since
they
couldn
t
remember
the
rest
of
the
words
Bravo
Sterno
applauded
enthusiastically
Keep
it
up
you
re
doing
great
Von
Liederkranz
grinned
broadly
and
began
dancing
with
greater
enthusiasm
although
no
better
rhythm
He
headed
out
the
door
and
down
the
hall
the
Nazi
chorus
line
crowding
awkwardly
behind
him
Fabulous
Sterno
enthused
He
signalled
to
Ernie
the
Fly
and
Captain
Memory
who
caught
the
hint
and
began
applauding
as
well
Wonderful
Tremendous
they
all
cheered
The
Nazi
s
voices
began
receding
down
the
hall
Sterno
gestured
towards
the
French
doors
leading
to
the
outside
The
four
got
up
and
began
tiptoeing
towards
them
Suddenly
the
heard
a
resounding
crash
coming
from
down
the
hall
Dummkopf
Schweinhund
cried
a
voice
followed
by
the
snap
of
a
riding
crop
RUN
cried
Sterno
The
foursome
charged
through
the
French
doors
and
went
sprinting
across
the
field
behind
the
house
In
a
few
moments
the
English
Tudor
mansion
was
out
of
view
Peculiarly
enough
as
soon
as
they
left
the
mansion
it
was
mid
afternoon
again
The
darkness
seemed
to
have
been
confined
to
the
study
The
four
slowed
down
to
a
walk
exhausted
and
out
of
breath
Ernie
looked
back
There
was
no
sign
of
pursuit
Looks
like
they
re
still
trying
to
get
their
act
together
Captain
Memory
commented
That
act
has
got
let
s
say
a
few
rough
spots
that
need
to
be
ironed
out
Sterno
snickered
I
think
they
re
going
to
be
working
on
it
for
rather
a
long
time
Ernie
sighed
with
relief
Those
Nazis
made
him
very
uneasy
The
four
continued
walking
They
were
in
the
midst
of
what
seemed
to
be
many
acres
of
lush
grassy
meadow
A
short
distance
ahead
Ernie
spotted
flock
of
sheep
peacefully
grazing
Sheep
Ernie
exclaimed
Really
Sterno
asked
sarcastically
How
clever
of
you
to
figure
that
out
A
small
group
of
sheep
detached
themselves
from
the
flock
and
walked
up
to
the
foursome
Ernie
noticed
that
they
looked
much
like
the
other
sheep
in
the
flock
except
for
the
fact
that
they
were
wearing
dark
sunglasses
Looking
closely
he
could
see
that
some
of
them
seemed
to
be
carrying
some
objects
that
looked
a
lot
like
hmm
well
like
surfboards
Baa
the
first
sheep
said
as
if
in
greeting
Baa
Baa
Sterno
replied
The
sheep
seemed
to
respond
favorably
to
this
You
speak
their
language
Ernie
was
astounded
Of
course
Sterno
replied
offhandedly
I
was
always
a
great
student
of
foreign
languages
But
what
language
do
they
speak
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Sheepish
of
course
Sterno
replied
in
a
patronizing
tone
Everybody
knows
THAT
The
lead
sheep
continued
Baa
Baa
Baa
Ba
inquired
Sterno
Baa
Baa
Baa
the
lead
sheep
repeated
vigorously
A
second
later
the
next
sheep
repeated
the
same
thing
Baa
Baa
Baa
And
then
the
next
sheep
picked
up
the
refrain
soon
they
were
all
chanting
Baa
Baa
Baa
Suddenly
the
lead
sheep
launched
into
the
main
verse
Baa
Baa
Baa
Baa
Barbara
Ann
Oh
it
s
the
Beach
Sheep
the
Fly
exclaimed
By
now
the
entire
group
of
sheep
had
launched
into
the
song
in
full
chorus
They
re
not
bad
admitted
Ernie
Even
the
President
likes
the
Beach
Sheep
the
Fly
asserted
Of
course
they
re
not
really
the
Beach
Sheep
Sterno
explained
They
re
not
the
Fly
seemed
very
disappointed
Don
t
be
silly
Sterno
sniggered
You
couldn
t
expect
the
real
Beach
Sheep
to
be
performing
in
a
little
out
of
the
way
meadow
like
this
could
you
The
only
play
the
really
big
fields
nowadays
Aww
The
Fly
s
antennae
drooped
No
continued
Sterno
They
re
just
one
of
a
whole
flock
of
Beach
Sheep
impersonators
A
good
imitation
but
not
the
real
thing
Ernie
thought
a
moment
You
mean
like
Elvis
impersonators
The
Sheepish
equivalent
Sterno
agreed
Having
finished
their
song
the
Beach
Sheep
began
discussing
something
with
Sterno
in
very
serious
tones
Ernie
of
course
couldn
t
understand
a
bleat
of
it
since
it
was
all
in
Sheepish
So
what
s
the
deal
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
It
seems
the
sheep
have
a
problem
Sterno
explained
They
re
being
oppressed
by
one
of
their
own
kind
a
cruel
tyrant
who
will
stop
at
nothing
to
get
his
own
way
Gee
that
s
tough
the
Fly
shook
his
head
sadly
What
s
this
tyrant
called
anyway
Ernie
was
curious
Sterno
paused
dramatically
They
call
him
the
Wooly
Bully
Ernie
frowned
That
name
seemed
somehow
familiar
to
him
The
Fly
started
snapping
his
fingers
and
humming
Wooly
bully
wooly
bully
Will
you
STOP
that
barked
Sterno
Have
some
respect
please
This
is
a
serious
problem
Oh
Sorry
The
Fly
fell
silent
Sterno
continued
conversing
with
