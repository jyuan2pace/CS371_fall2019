back
out
onto
the
road
The
stopped
to
get
their
bearings
Well
I
hope
you
re
satisfied
Sterno
said
contemptuously
to
Ernie
You
ve
really
made
a
mess
of
things
now
Me
cried
Ernie
Hey
I
m
not
the
one
who
left
those
cigar
butts
back
in
four
billion
B
C
It
s
not
MY
fault
Oh
sure
Sterno
interrupted
Try
and
blame
it
on
me
Hey
guys
the
Fly
broke
in
Look
at
that
The
Fly
s
huge
multi
faceted
eyes
had
picked
up
a
detail
the
others
had
failed
to
notice
behind
the
bank
was
a
small
flat
roofed
brick
building
A
neon
sign
proclaimed
Deer
Bar
There
was
a
large
picture
of
a
deer
beneath
it
Hey
guys
it
s
a
bar
the
Fly
continued
Whaddya
say
we
stop
in
for
a
drink
Hey
maybe
we
can
meet
some
girls
The
others
looked
at
each
others
confusedly
Hey
it
s
okay
guys
The
Fly
went
on
I
ll
buy
Captain
Memory
looked
relieved
Well
in
that
case
sure
Thanks
They
all
started
towards
the
bar
Ernie
was
finding
all
of
this
very
confusing
Every
time
he
thought
he
was
beginning
to
understand
what
was
going
on
events
took
a
turn
in
an
entirely
different
direction
Wasn
t
this
supposed
to
be
the
Emerald
City
He
didn
t
recall
any
bars
in
the
Emerald
City
And
what
about
that
bank
And
what
happened
to
Judy
Garland
They
entered
the
bar
Well
Ernie
thought
I
m
not
sure
if
this
is
a
good
idea
or
not
but
I
could
really
use
a
drink
Ernie
found
the
interior
of
the
bar
reassuring
It
was
cool
and
dark
It
looked
like
a
typical
corner
bar
with
a
typical
corner
bartender
In
one
corner
behind
the
bar
a
TV
set
was
mounted
but
luckily
it
was
turned
off
There
were
few
other
customers
in
the
place
but
of
course
business
was
always
kind
of
slow
in
the
middle
of
the
day
They
seated
themselves
at
the
bar
They
bartender
a
portly
balding
man
smoking
a
cigar
came
up
to
them
What
ll
you
have
What
kind
of
beer
you
got
The
Fly
wanted
to
know
Deer
Deer
The
Fly
was
puzzled
Deer
Beer
the
bartender
stated
matter
of
factly
This
is
the
Deer
Bar
we
got
Deer
Beer
You
want
it
or
not
Uh
yeah
okay
the
Fly
replied
somewhat
confused
Uh
three
Deer
Beers
Ernie
looked
at
the
Fly
It
occurred
to
him
that
no
one
around
here
seemed
at
all
disturbed
by
the
Fly
s
looks
That
seemed
to
a
bit
odd
He
would
have
expected
the
Fly
to
have
attracted
somewhat
more
attention
But
then
on
the
other
hand
Ernie
thought
it
probably
didn
t
mean
anything
After
all
everything
is
pretty
strange
around
here
Ernie
appreciated
the
opportunity
to
relax
and
have
a
beer
The
Fly
pointed
into
the
darkness
at
the
far
end
of
the
bar
Hey
get
a
load
of
that
babe
he
said
to
Ernie
his
antennae
waving
excitedly
Ernie
peered
intently
He
could
just
barely
see
in
the
dim
light
a
rather
disreputable
looking
young
woman
with
bleached
blond
hair
and
a
skimpy
outfit
perched
on
a
stool
at
the
far
end
of
the
bar
What
s
your
name
dear
The
Fly
called
out
to
her
Bambi
she
replied
The
Fly
was
encouraged
Hey
whaddya
say
we
Cost
you
bucks
she
interrupted
The
Fly
s
antennae
drooped
dispiritedly
How
come
there
aren
t
any
nice
girls
around
anymore
He
turned
back
to
his
beer
Sterno
looked
about
worriedly
He
sniffed
Something
smells
very
peculiar
around
here
Probably
just
onions
Ernie
was
unconcerned
Hardly
sniffed
Sterno
There
is
something
seriously
wrong
about
this
place
NOW
who
s
paranoid
Ernie
dismissed
Sterno
s
fears
Just
then
the
door
to
the
bar
opened
and
a
woman
walked
in
She
had
flaming
red
hair
and
was
wearing
a
s
style
party
dress
Hi
there
fellas
she
said
loudly
HI
The
Fly
jumped
up
his
antennae
waving
excitedly
Say
can
I
buy
you
a
drink
Sure
she
answered
in
a
brassy
voice
Ernie
looked
at
the
woman
Not
my
type
he
thought
Too
loud
He
looked
at
her
again
Something
about
her
seemed
very
familiar
Ernie
was
sure
he
had
seen
her
before
but
he
couldn
t
quite
remember
where
Gee
she
said
to
the
Fly
You
sure
are
different
looking
Where
are
you
from
The
Fly
thought
quickly
Uh
France
Oh
sure
I
know
France
the
woman
answered
brightly
Ooh
la
la
c
est
la
vie
Eiffel
Tower
right
Sure
you
got
it
The
Fly
whispered
aside
to
the
others
Oh
boy
oh
boy
I
m
really
getting
somewhere
now
He
turned
back
to
the
woman
So
like
what
s
your
name
Lucy
she
answered
loudly
The
door
opened
again
and
a
swarthy
man
with
slicked
back
black
hair
entered
He
was
wearing
a
Cuban
shirt
with
huge
ruffled
sleeves
and
carrying
a
pair
of
maracas
The
woman
gestured
towards
the
man
And
this
is
my
husband
Ricky
Aww
the
Fly
s
antennae
drooped
How
you
do
said
the
man
with
a
heavy
Spanish
accent
I
m
Ricky
Ricardo
de
famous
Cuban
bandleader
He
shook
his
maracas
rhythmically
Chick
a
boom
chick
a
boom
Yeah
Hi
the
Fly
answered
glumly
He
turned
to
the
others
Wouldn
t
you
know
she
s
married
He
was
obviously
deeply
disappointed
He
brightened
a
bit
Say
he
said
to
Lucy
You
wouldn
t
happen
to
have
any
girlfriends
you
could
ask
over
do
you
Friends
said
Lucy
shrilly
Sure
I
got
friends
In
fact
a
couple
of
them
are
on
there
way
over
right
now
The
Fly
was
thrilled
Oh
boy
oh
boy
His
antennae
waved
excitedly
He
turned
to
Ricky
Hey
I
like
the
shirt
guy
It
s
the
new
in
thing
right
Chure
Ricky
agreed
Ees
de
latest
style
in
Habana
The
door
opened
and
in
walked
an
older
couple
also
dressed
in
s
styles
Oh
said
Lucy
Here
s
my
friends
now
Fellas
this
is
Fred
and
Ethel
Mertz
Aww
The
Fly
was
disappointed
These
weren
t
the
type
of
friends
he
had
been
hoping
for
Sterno
leaned
forward
There
is
something
terribly
wrong
with
these
people
he
said
to
Ernie
and
the
Captain
I
can
smell
it
Leave
me
alone
said
Ernie
He
hadn
t
forgiven
Sterno
for
blaming
the
bank
problem
on
him
All
these
people
looked
terribly
familiar
to
Ernie
Suddenly
he
had
it
I
ve
got
it
he
shouted
The
Fly
was
more
mystified
than
ever
Now
HE
S
got
it
What
is
it
contagious
He
edged
away
from
Ernie
slightly
No
not
THAT
said
Ernie
impatiently
I
just
remembered
it
s
I
Love
Lucy
Lucy
put
her
hand
on
Ernie
s
arm
I
love
you
too
She
said
She
edged
closer
Now
that
we
re
friends
I
d
like
to
ask
you
a
little
favor
What
asked
Ernie
suspiciously
It
s
just
a
little
thing
she
began
hesitantly
What
He
edged
away
uncomfortably
We
d
just
like
to
borrow
it
just
for
a
little
while
We
ll
bring
it
right
back
What
Ernie
was
getting
impatient
Um
Lucy
seemed
a
bit
embarrassed
We
d
like
to
borrow
your
brain
MY
BRAIN
shrieked
Ernie
We
just
want
to
borrow
it
said
Lucy
quickly
Just
for
a
little
while
We
re
not
going
to
steal
it
Lucy
laughed
nervously
NO
Ernie
cried
Really
you
don
t
have
anything
to
worry
about
Lucy
continued
We
re
not
going
to
take
it
back
to
our
home
planet
or
anything
And
we
re
certainly
not
going
to
put
it
into
a
giant
killer
robot
and
use
it
to
take
over
the
Earth
She
laughed
We
would
never
do
that
She
turned
to
Ricky
and
the
Mertz
s
Would
we
Oh
no
they
all
laughed
We
d
never
do
that
Never
There
that
proves
it
Lucy
concluded
So
how
about
it
She
reached
towards
Ernie
s
head
NO
Ernie
screamed
leaping
off
the
bar
stool
Keep
your
hands
off
my
brain
He
whipped
out
his
plastic
broadsword
and
brandished
it
menacingly
After
standing
there
a
few
moments
Ernie
became
aware
of
everyone
looking
at
him
very
peculiarly
Hey
guy
the
Fly
inquired
Like
what
are
you
gonna
do
with
that
plastic
sword
Ernie
could
hear
the
sound
of
muffled
laughter
but
he
couldn
t
tell
where
it
was
coming
from
Ernie
glowered
Okay
okay
he
said
replacing
the
sword
in
it
s
sheath
Just
keep
your
hands
off
my
brain
all
right
Lucy
frowned
She
looked
at
Sterno
and
then
looked
at
her
companions
Dog
brain
she
asked
them
They
all
shook
their
heads
no
She
looked
at
the
Fly
Fly
brain
she
asked
Ricky
and
the
Mertz
s
Nope
They
shook
their
heads
She
looked
at
Captain
Memory
She
smiled
broadly
I
wonder
if
I
could
ask
you
a
favor
she
began
No
chance
Captain
Memory
cut
her
off
Her
expression
became
ugly
Extremely
ugly
In
fact
thought
Ernie
she
was
changing
into
just
about
the
ugliest
thing
Ernie
had
ever
seen
Lucy
snarled
revealing
rows
of
pointed
reptilian
looking
teeth
and
a
forked
tongue
Foolish
Earth
creatures
she
hissed
pulling
out
a
frightening
looking
weapon
You
will
turn
your
brains
over
to
us
or
we
will
destroy
this
miserable
planet
of
yours
Who
ARE
these
people
Ernie
whispered
to
Captain
Memory
Remember
I
told
you
about
those
aliens
Captain
Memory
asked
Ernie
nodded
Well
here
they
are
Hey
guys
what
do
we
do
now
the
Fly
asked
Ernie
and
Captain
Memory
looking
at
Lucy
s
weapon
uneasily
Captain
Memory
looked
up
brightly
Hey
he
said
to
Lucy
and
her
companions
Wanna
watch
some
TV
Lucy
and
the
other
aliens
were
totally
confused
Watch
TV
I
don
t
remember
that
Is
that
in
the
script
What
are
we
supposed
to
do
They
looked
at
each
other
confusedly
Oh
wow
look
what
s
on
Before
anyone
could
stop
him
Captain
Memory
had
reached
behind
the
bar
and
turned
on
the
TV
It
s
time
for
Wheel
of
Torture
CHAPTER
An
image
of
Sturmbannfuhrer
Dr
Heinz
von
Liederkranz
filled
the
screen
Vis
us
tonight
he
began
Ve
haff
our
contestants
from
our
last
show
He
turned
to
introduce
them
First
Captain
Memory
Captain
Memory
bowed
to
polite
applause
from
the
audience
Goombah
de
Barbarian
Ernie
blinked
and
staggered
Once
again
he
suddenly
found
himself
on
the
game
show
stage
His
stomach
flipped
over
once
again
He
hated
these
abrupt
changes
of
scene
Not
again
he
moaned
Captain
Memory
shrugged
Hey
that
s
show
biz
The
audience
was
staring
at
Ernie
They
seemed
to
be
expecting
something
He
smiled
and
waved
half
heartedly
The
audience
tittered
and
applauded
weakly
Ernie
noticed
that
the
audience
was
still
made
up
entirely
of
Nazis
He
sighed
He
might
have
known
he
would
wind
up
back
here
he
thought
Whatever
the
worst
thing
is
that
could
possibly
happen
that
s
what
will
happen
Ernie
frowned
In
fact
this
was
even
the
worst
thing
that
couldn
t
possibly
happen
and
it
was
happening
anyway
Wasn
t
that
against
Murphy
s
Law
or
something
Anyway
it
was
all
very
confusing
Von
Liederkranz
turned
to
the
other
side
of
the
stage
Ernie
noticed
that
the
aliens
had
been
transported
onto
the
game
show
as
well
and
were
now
staggering
and
blinking
just
like
Ernie
Und
tonight
ve
have
vith
us
special
guests
von
Liederkranz
said
gesturing
towards
the
aliens
with
his
riding
crop
Lucy
and
Ricky
Ricardo
the
famous
Cuban
bandleader
and
their
friends
Fred
and
Ethel
Mertz
Thunderous
applause
greeted
the
introduction
The
aliens
were
utterly
confused
Chick
a
boom
asked
Ricky
shaking
his
maracas
feebly
The
Mertz
s
drew
alien
weapons
pointing
them
in
all
directions
uncertainly
Und
now
ze
big
question
von
Liederkranz
said
to
the
aliens
Vill
you
take
vot
s
in
dis
bag
he
held
up
a
small
paper
bag
which
looked
a
lot
like
somebody
s
lunch
Or
try
for
vot
s
behind
door
number
four
The
audience
was
hushed
with
anticipation
The
aliens
looked
at
each
other
in
confusion
What
do
we
do
I
wasn
t
prepared
for
this
I
don
t
know
what
to
do
they
told
each
other
Captain
Memory
decided
to
help
them
out
Anyone
with
any
BRAINS
would
take
what
s
behind
door
number
four
he
hinted
The
aliens
brightened
Brains
Brains
Yes
that
s
it
Let
s
take
what
s
behind
door
number
four
They
looked
pleased
Chick
a
BOOM
said
Ricky
definitely
Door
number
four
it
is
called
out
von
Liederkranz
The
audience
roared
it
s
approval
An
attractive
woman
in
a
chorus
girl
outfit
opened
door
number
four
and
the
aliens
filed
in
looking
very
pleased
As
soon
as
the
last
alien
was
inside
the
door
slammed
with
a
metallic
crash
The
chorus
girl
reached
over
and
daintily
locked
it
Immediately
Ernie
began
to
hear
the
sounds
of
commotion
coming
from
behind
the
door
At
first
pounding
then
thuds
then
shrill
blood
curdling
screams
The
screams
continued
for
several
minutes
and
then
died
away
Finally
all
was
silent
behind
door
number
four
The
audience
applauded
Vell
von
Liederkranz
announced
jovially
Looks
like

vot
dey

to

t

He
laughed
He
turned
to
Ernie
Captain
Memory
and
the
others
Ernie
noticed
that
while
their
attention
had
been
drawn
elsewhere
guards
with
machine
guns
had
surrounded
them
Shtill
it
vas
very
considerate
of
dem
to

he
said
with
an
evil
gleam
in
his
eye
I

Blaster
Von
Liederkranz
turned
to
the
guard
nearest
him
for
vhich
YOU

He
lashed
the
guard
with
his
riding
crop
But
Herr
Doktor
the
guard
protested
I
vasn
t
even
there
Shut
up
von
Liederkranz
snapped
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Und
now
perhaps
ve
vill
continue

ze
questions
ja
He
smiled
sadistically
You
remember
vhere
ve
left

Vis

Hot

Corkscrew
A
guard
handed
von
Liederkranz
the
by
now
familiar
diabolical
looking
device
which
began
to
glow
and
whirl
Von
Liederkranz
smiled
evilly
He
began
slowly
advancing
toward
Captain
Memory
with
his
device
Von
Liederkranz
was
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
a
knock
He
looked
around
There
it
was
again
someone
was
knocking
on
the
stage
door
Von
Liederkranz
was
annoyed
Answer
ze
door
dummkopf
he
snapped
at
one
of
the
guards
The
guard
opened
the
door
Mailman
A
fellow
in
a
post
office
uniform
walked
in
the
door
Got
a
special
delivery
letter
here
Von
Liederkranz
narrowed
his
eyes
suspiciously
For
who
Is
there
a
Mr
Ernest
Ross
here
Uh
that
s
me
Ernie
said
Here
you
go
The
mailman
handed
Ernie
a
letter
Everything
stopped
while
Ernie
opened
the
letter
Von
Liederkranz
and
the
Nazis
milled
about
confusedly
Ernie
was
totally
mystified
Who
could
be
sending
him
a
letter
here
Nobody
knew
he
was
here
and
even
if
they
did
why
would
they
send
him
a
letter
here
Ernie
tore
the
letter
open
and
read
Dear
Mr
Ross

Ernie
looked
up
Von
Liederkranz
was
watching
him
very
carefully
Ernie
had
an
idea
Oops
looks
like
I
gotta
go
pay
a
bill
See
ya
Ernie
started
towards
the
door
Not
so
fast
Von
Liederkranz
blocked
Ernie
s
path
Give
me
dot
letter
He
snatched
it
out
of
Ernie
s
hand
Der
Sturmbannfuhrer
was
very
upset
How
dare
they
interrupt
his
game
show
to
deliver
a
letter
And
just
exactly
who
was
this
message
from
anyway
And
what
did
it
really
mean
Von
Liederkranz
examined
the
letter
carefully
Zo
he
said
thoughtfully
You

hundred
and
ninety
five
quadrillion
dollars
Just
as
we
thought
Of
course
it
wasn
t
really
what
he
thought
at
all
The
Nazi
s
eyes
narrowed
Zis
one
hundred
and
ninety
five
quadrillion
dollars
it
is
a
great
deal
of
money
ja
Ja
I
mean
yes
agreed
Ernie
It
is
more
even
than
I
make
in
a
veek
Von
Liederkranz
eyed
Ernie
suspiciously
Zo
how
is
it
dot
you
come
to
owe
zo
much
money
Well
you
see
there
was
this
problem
with
cigar
butts
two
billion
years
ago
Ernie
explained
nervously
He
didn
t
like
the
Nazi
s
tone
of
voice
and
he
particularly
didn
t
like
the
Hot
Whirling
Corkscrew
And
then
we
were
at
the
bank
and
I
had
to
go
and
open
my
big
mouth
and
so
then
SCHWEINHUND
Von
Liederkranz
whipped
Ernie
with
the
letter
Do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
No
one
could
possibly
owe
zis
much
money
Obviously
zis
is
some
sort
of
secret
code
Now
who
vould
be
sending
you
secret
coded
messages
HERE
on
mein
own
game
show
Ernie
looked
pleadingly
at
Captain
Memory
the
Captain
just
shrugged
Von
Liederkranz
continued
reflectively
Und
how
could
zey
know
vhere
to
find
you
vis
zis
message
unless
He
whirled
to
face
his
guards
One
of
YOU
is
a
traitor
Nein
Nein
The
guards
blanched
and
backed
away
Von
Liederkranz
looked
at
the
audience
Or
perhaps
one
of
YOU
NEIN
NEIN
the
audience
cried
out
in
unison
fidgeting
uncomfortably
in
their
seats
Von
Liederkranz
advanced
on
the
audience
the
Hot
Whirling
Corkscrew
spinning
and
glowing
in
his
hand
Zo
you
vill
not
confess
eh
he
shrieked
at
the
audience
Perhaps
a
taste
of
the
Corkscrew
vill
loosen
your
tongues
Ernie
felt
a
tap
on
his
shoulder
Captain
Memory
beckoned
towards
the
back
of
the
stage
All
eyes
were
riveted
on
von
Liederkranz
and
on
the
hissing
spinning
torture
device
in
his
hand
No
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
the
foursome
They
tiptoed
into
the
wings
and
back
behind
the
stage
As
they
left
they
began
to
hear
screams
coming
from
somewhere
in
the
audience
They
hurried
along
the
corridor
leading
to
the
dressing
rooms
backstage
Unfortunately
there
seemed
to
be
no
exits
anywhere
in
that
part
of
the
building
The
only
exits
were
through
the
main
floor
which
would
have
required
them
to
go
back
out
onto
the
stage
This
did
not
seem
like
a
very
good
idea
An
empty
dressing
room
beckoned
ahead
of
them
They
hurried
into
it
and
locked
the
door
behind
them
The
screams
were
still
audible
inside
the
room
Hey
guys
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
Like
what
are
we
gonna
do
now
Ernie
sneezed
I
wish
they
wouldn
t
keep
the
air
conditioning
turned
up
so
high
he
complained
shivering
Well
if
you
re
going
to
go
around
wearing
nothing
but
that
ridiculous
fur
loincloth
you
have
to
expect
to
get
a
chill
commented
Sterno
unsympathetically
We
d
all
feel
a
lot
better
if
you
d
cover
up
some
of
that
pallid
skin
of
yours
Hey
that
s
an
idea
the
Fly
chimed
in
This
is
a
dressing
room
Maybe
there
s
some
clothes
here
you
can
wear
That
seemed
like
a
good
idea
to
Ernie
He
d
been
uncomfortably
cold
ever
since
he
d
put
that
silly
loincloth
on
He
began
looking
through
the
closet
but
found
only
filmy
negligees
and
harem
girl
outfits
Hey
there
s
a
whole
wardrobe
room
next
door
the
Fly
pointed
to
an
adjoining
room
Take
a
look
in
there
Ernie
disappeared
into
the
next
room
Sterno
was
searching
the
room
carefully
What
cha
looking
for
secret
passages
the
Fly
asked
eagerly
Actually
I
was
rather
hoping
someone
might
have
left
a
spot
of
brandy
about
he
answered
Aha
He
pulled
out
a
bottle
A
look
of
disappointment
appeared
on
his
face
MD
he
asked
What
in
the
world
could
that
be
Oh
wow
commented
the
Fly
Mad
Dog
I
beg
your
pardon
snapped
Sterno
huffily
Hey
no
offense
said
the
Fly
quickly
That
s
just
what
it
s
called
you
know
Hmmph
Sterno
opened
the
bottle
and
sniffed
the
contents
Dreadful
he
proclaimed
and
dropped
the
bottle
in
the
trash
Ernie
reappeared
from
the
wardrobe
room
He
was
now
clad
in
a
Spanish
toreador
outfit
consisting
of
a
scintillating
gold
suit
covered
with
sequins
with
knee
breeches
and
white
stockings
a
white
shirt
and
tie
and
an
odd
shaped
little
black
hat
He
noticed
everyone
looking
at
him
oddly
Hey
it
was
the
only
thing
I
could
find
you
know
Ernie
said
defensively
At
least
it
s
warm
Sterno
sniffed
I
must
say
you
have
the
most
AWFUL
taste
in
clothes
But
at
least
it
s
better
than
looking
at
that
sickening
body
of
yours
Ernie
was
offended
What
s
wrong
with
my
body
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
silently
Only
the
Fly
seemed
to
approve
of
Ernie
s
new
outfit
Hey
guy
