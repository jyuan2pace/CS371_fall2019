steal
popsicles
he
wondered
Because
they
haven
t
any
money
I
suppose
Sterno
mused
They
can
t
buy
them
if
they
haven
t
any
money
now
can
they
I
suppose
they
ll
just
have
to
steal
them
then
Uh
Ernie
felt
unsatisfied
by
this
line
of
reasoning
They
can
t
very
well
just
go
out
and
get
jobs
now
can
they
Sterno
continued
After
all
who
d
hire
an
alien
McDonalds
Would
you
really
want
to
buy
a
hamburger
from
an
alien
Ernie
thought
about
the
frozen
alien
and
his
stomach
flipped
over
again
Um
no
Well
that
proves
it
then
Sterno
leaned
back
triumphantly
Ernie
sighed
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
The
others
all
seemed
absorbed
in
their
own
pursuits
Ernie
fidgeted
uncomfortably
His
stomach
growled
He
was
beginning
to
get
ravenously
hungry
He
looked
at
the
kitchen
door
Maybe
he
could
try
the
kitchen
one
more
time
The
kitchen
looked
a
lot
like
something
out
of
a
s
Better
Homes
Gardens
magazine
It
was
painted
in
cheerful
colors
with
cast
iron
trivets
hanging
on
the
walls
as
decorations
Ernie
would
have
found
it
quite
homey
if
he
hadn
t
known
that
there
was
a
Thing
in
the
freezer
Avoiding
the
refrigerator
he
walked
over
to
a
row
of
cabinets
and
began
rummaging
through
them
The
contents
of
the
cabinets
turned
out
to
be
disappointing
There
were
none
of
Ernie
s
favorite
foods
He
looked
through
the
containers
Hearts
of
Toad
No
Poisonberry
Yogurt
I
don
t
think
so
What
s
this
Ernie
grabbed
a
box
of
what
appeared
to
be
peanut
brittle
Great
he
thought
I
love
peanut
brittle
He
was
just
about
to
tear
into
it
when
he
noticed
the
label
Cockroach
Crunch
He
put
it
back
gingerly
He
decided
that
perhaps
he
wasn
t
all
that
hungry
after
all
Ernie
was
just
about
to
give
up
and
go
back
into
the
living
room
when
he
noticed
a
familiar
looking
object
on
the
counter
nearby
He
looked
at
it
more
closely
It
seemed
to
be
an
old
s
style
coffee
maker
It
seemed
to
Ernie
that
he
could
sure
use
a
cup
of
coffee
right
now
He
examined
it
more
closely
Hey
This
is
Bakelite
Genuine
Bakelite
This
must
be
one
of
the
first
coffee
makers
ever
made
What
a
treasure
Plastic
collectors
would
pay
a
fortune
for
this
He
picked
it
up
and
carried
it
into
the
living
room
Hey
guys
Ernie
announced
Look
what
I
found
Captain
Memory
started
as
he
saw
what
Ernie
was
carrying
Wow
Where
d
you
get
that
Ernie
was
excited
It
was
just
sitting
on
the
counter
in
the
kitchen
Do
you
know
what
that
is
Captain
Memory
enthused
That
s
a
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
I
wonder
what
it
s
doing
on
this
planet
Ernie
s
heart
sank
Does
this
mean
I
m
not
going
to
get
a
cup
of
coffee
Captain
Memory
continued
to
enthuse
Wow
A
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
Right
here
Right
in
our
own
living
room
Sterno
who
up
to
this
point
had
not
been
paying
any
attention
looked
up
irritatedly
What
What
kind
of
nonsense
are
you
going
on
about
now
It
s
a
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
I
can
t
believe
it
The
Captain
seemed
really
enraptured
by
it
I
just
can
t
tell
you
how
thrilled
I
am
about
that
Sterno
yawned
Or
rather
I
could
but
I
d
rather
not
be
impolite
So
instead
why
don
t
you
just
tell
us
what
this
thing
is
supposed
to
be
It
s
a
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
The
Captain
was
indeed
very
excited
Sterno
sighed
Okay
We
understand
that
Now
why
don
t
you
just
calm
down
and
tell
us
what
it
s
supposed
to
do
Captain
Memory
seemed
taken
aback
Do
Sterno
spoke
each
word
slowly
and
carefully
as
though
talking
to
a
small
child
What
is
it
supposed
to
do
Captain
Memory
shifted
uncomfortably
Hmmm
lemme
think
Uh
I
used
to
know
that
I
used
to
know
all
that
stuff
Sterno
repeated
himself
speaking
even
more
slowly
and
carefully
as
though
to
someone
who
did
not
speak
English
very
well
What
is
it
supposed
to
do
Ernie
examined
the
device
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Are
you
sure
this
thing
is
really
a
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
Oh
absolutely
The
Captain
looked
very
relieved
that
someone
had
broken
the
awkward
silence
Then
how
come
it
says
Mr
Coffee
on
it
It
s
a
Mr
Coffee
brand
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
What
s
wrong
with
that
the
Captain
wanted
to
know
Ernie
was
becoming
more
and
more
skeptical
So
how
come
it
says
makes
cups
Drip
grind
only
Well
uh
I
m
sure
there
s
a
logical
explanation
for
that
Captain
Memory
said
evasively
I
just
can
t
quite
think
of
it
at
the
moment
Ernie
narrowed
his
eyes
suspiciously
Are
you
sure
this
isn
t
a
coffee
maker
Uh
Captain
Memory
stopped
Suddenly
his
eyes
lit
up
I
ve
got
it
NOW
I
remember
Of
course
why
didn
t
I
think
of
it
Now
I
remember
what
a
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
is
supposed
to
do
Sterno
was
not
impressed
Okay
What
It
makes
coffee
Captain
Memory
cried
out
triumphantly
Ernie
set
the
coffee
maker
on
the
table
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
rubbing
his
head
wearily
Why
did
everything
always
have
to
be
so
complicated
Captain
Memory
looked
around
at
everyone
obviously
disappointed
Sterno
was
pointedly
looking
in
another
direction
The
Fly
was
talking
to
Mr
Ed
Ernie
was
wearily
cradling
his
head
in
his
hands
No
one
seemed
to
be
greeting
the
Captain
s
announcement
with
much
enthusiasm
Of
course
I
could
be
wrong
The
Captain
said
tentatively
No
one
answered
Ernie
began
examining
the
coffee
maker
He
wasn
t
quite
sure
how
to
work
an
old
model
like
this
He
turned
it
over
There
seemed
to
be
some
directions
on
the
bottom
but
the
were
all
covered
with
coffee
stains
and
were
practically
impossible
to
read
He
would
probably
just
have
to
figure
it
out
himself
Wait
a
minute
The
Captain
said
urgently
Ernie
looked
up
Now
what
It
just
occurred
to
me
that
uh
Captain
Memory
looked
embarrassed
Maybe
the
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
doesn
t
make
coffee
after
all
So
what
does
it
do
instead
Make
tea
Um
no
The
Captain
looked
uncomfortable
I
think
it
uh
destroys
planets
Ernie
gave
the
Captain
a
disgusted
look
There
uh
isn
t
any
place
to
put
peanut
butter
in
that
thing
is
there
the
Captain
asked
intensely
Ernie
examined
it
No
Nothing
about
peanut
butter
No
little
door
or
compartment
or
anything
Ernie
looked
it
over
Nope
The
Captain
seemed
relieved
Okay
okay
Forget
that
Forget
I
said
anything
about
peanut
butter
I
m
absolutely
sure
that
it
uh
destroys
planets
Or
makes
coffee
It
for
sure
either
destroys
planets
or
makes
coffee
Captain
Memory
beamed
pleased
with
himself
for
having
solved
this
difficult
problem
Ernie
examined
the
machine
more
closely
There
was
a
lever
on
the
top
which
was
labelled
Mild
on
one
side
and
Full
on
the
other
He
also
found
a
two
position
switch
on
the
side
There
were
little
words
printed
next
to
each
position
Unfortunately
the
ink
had
rubbed
off
of
them
and
they
were
very
difficult
to
read
Ernie
peered
closely
He
wasn
t
sure
but
the
positions
seemed
to
be
labelled
Brew
and
Destroy
Ernie
sighed
He
was
rapidly
losing
interest
in
the
entire
subject
Idly
he
flipped
the
switch
Instantly
the
earth
rumbled
the
building
shook
Ernie
hastily
flipped
the
switch
back
again
Sterno
turned
to
Ernie
irritatedly
Who
did
that
Did
you
do
that
Uh
yeah
I
Well
you
could
at
least
excuse
yourself
Sterno
snapped
Oh
Sorry
Somehow
Ernie
always
seemed
to
wind
up
feeling
that
he
was
at
fault
Captain
Memory
was
beaming
Well
that
settles
that
doesn
t
it
It
destroys
planets
I
was
right
all
along
Of
course
I
was
Ernie
regarded
the
device
ruefully
He
noticed
a
small
faded
tag
on
the
side
which
read
WARNING
Follow
instructions
carefully
The
manufacturer
assumes
no
responsibility
for
damage
to
planets
due
to
failure
to
follow
said
instructions
Such
failure
will
also
void
your
warranty
Ernie
sighed
There
goes
my
cup
of
coffee
Captain
Memory
returned
to
consulting
his
TV
Guide
An
object
on
the
coffee
table
caught
Ernie
s
attention
It
was
a
small
rectangular
object
wrapped
in
paper
He
picked
it
up
It
seemed
to
be
a
candy
bar
Ernie
s
stomach
started
grumbling
again
He
was
feeling
very
sorry
for
himself
at
the
moment
He
hadn
t
had
anything
to
eat
for
a
very
long
time
How
come
everybody
else
got
to
eat
but
not
him
He
couldn
t
even
get
a
cup
of
coffee
He
unwrapped
the
object
It
looked
like
a
candy
bar
It
smelled
like
a
candy
bar
A
wave
of
guilt
suddenly
came
over
him
He
probably
shouldn
t
eat
it
It
probably
belonged
to
Captain
Memory
But
then
on
the
other
hand
maybe
it
had
been
on
the
coffee
table
all
along
and
he
just
hadn
t
noticed
it
Ernie
brightened
In
any
case
that
sounded
like
a
good
excuse
to
him
He
took
a
bite
Quite
tasty
although
it
did
have
an
odd
crunch
He
ate
the
rest
of
the
bar
and
tossed
the
wrapper
under
the
sofa
Ernie
was
beginning
to
feel
somewhat
better
Suddenly
the
telephone
rang
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
Captain
Memory
looked
at
Ernie
Well
the
Captain
demanded
Uh
the
telephone
s
ringing
said
Ernie
uncomfortably
Are
you
going
to
answer
it
the
Captain
wanted
to
know
Um
you
want
me
to
answer
it
Well
it
s
on
your
side
It
was
indeed
sitting
on
an
end
table
right
next
to
Ernie
I
thought
they
didn
t
have
telephones
in
ancient
Rome
said
Ernie
uneasily
For
god
s
sake
answer
the
telephone
already
cried
Sterno
That
ringing
is
driving
me
crazy
Ernie
picked
up
the
phone
Yo
cried
the
voice
on
the
other
end
Ernie
Ross
right
Uh
yeah
answered
Ernie
uneasily
He
wasn
t
expecting
to
get
any
calls
in
ancient
Rome
Dis
is
Vito
We
got
a
little
matter
to
discuss
about
a
uh
PLUS
INTEREST
you
know
what
I
mean
We
re
gonna
get
dis
money
you
know
what
I
mean
So
uh
are
you
gonna
make
it
easy
on
yourself
and
give
it
to
us
now
or
are
we
gonna
have
to
get
it
outta
you
like
da
hard
way
Well
look
I
got
this
problem
Ernie
began
desperately
You
tink
you
gotta
problem
now
Vito
interrupted
It
ain
t
nothin
compared
to
the
problem
you
gonna
have
if
you
don
t
pay
up
Well
Ernie
tried
again
Look
Vito
broke
in
I
m
comin
to
get
da
money
punk
and
you
better
have
it
OR
ELSE
He
hung
up
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Maybe
we
should
go
someplace
else
he
suggested
Okay
said
the
Captain
agreeably
Where
Ernie
concentrated
I
know
he
said
brightly
How
about
we
go
to
the
Middle
East
and
look
for
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Sterno
moaned
Not
THAT
again
The
Captain
looked
doubtful
It
s
kind
of
a
long
walk
Ernie
frowned
Can
t
you
just
transport
us
there
Well
you
know
I
don
t
really
like
to
do
that
too
often
answered
the
Captain
There
s
always
a
certain
amount
of
risk
With
these
locations
changing
all
the
time
there
s
always
a
chance
of
a
FATAL
ERROR
creeping
in
and
Okay
okay
said
Ernie
quickly
Forget
I
said
it
okay
Have
it
your
way
said
the
Captain
agreeably
Ernie
sighed
All
of
this
was
just
too
much
for
him
If
only
we
had
some
kind
of
vehicle
or
something
A
spaceship
or
even
a
car
Captain
Memory
looked
thoughtful
Oh
you
want
a
spaceship
You
have
a
SPACESHIP
Ernie
cried
Well
it
s
just
a
little
something
I
take
out
on
the
weekends
the
Captain
explained
modestly
It
s
no
big
deal
I
mean
it
doesn
t
have
a
kitchen
or
a
porta
john
or
anything
It
s
just
for
short
hops
like
around
the
solar
system
or
something
It
s
called
the
Luna
C
Lunacy
Sterno
inquired
Oh
no
Captain
Memory
laughed
The
Luna
C
Why
C
Ernie
was
curious
Well
you
know
after
the
Luna
A
and
the
Luna
B
there
s
the
Luna
C
Captain
Memory
explained
So
what
happened
to
the
Luna
A
and
the
Luna
B
Sterno
wanted
to
know
Captain
Memory
suddenly
became
very
quiet
After
a
few
moments
he
muttered
Well
well
it
wasn
t
my
fault
Ernie
frowned
What
wasn
t
It
was
a
stupid
place
to
put
a
planet
anyway
Captain
Memory
went
on
suddenly
indignant
I
mean
how
was
I
supposed
to
know
there
was
a
planet
in
that
sector
Nobody
would
ve
expected
a
planet
to
be
in
that
sector
A
planet
Ernie
asked
incredulously
Well
okay
okay
Captain
Memory
continued
defensively
Maybe
I
was
a
little
way
out
of
the
spacelane
It
could
happen
to
anybody
A
couple
of
light
years
this
way
or
that
A
couple
of
light
years
Sterno
inquired
Okay
okay
Captain
Memory
seemed
very
ill
at
ease
So
maybe
I
had
a
couple
of
drinks
Big
deal
I
mean
I
was
at
a
party
right
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
just
stand
around
all
night
Okay
so
maybe
I
shouldn
t
have
been
doing
Warp
in
a
Warp
zone
So
I
made
a
little
mistake
Big
deal
I
mean
what
am
I
supposed
to
do
pay
for
this
the
rest
of
my
life
or
what
Let
me
get
this
straight
Sterno
said
You
hit
a
planet
at
Warp
It
was
a
stupid
place
to
put
a
planet
Captain
Memory
repeated
petulantly
It
should
ve
had
a
guard
rail
or
something
So
what
happened
Ernie
asked
incredulously
Oh
Captain
Memory
looked
at
the
ground
I
hadda
pay
for
it
You
had
to
pay
for
a
PLANET
Well
I
had
insurance
the
Captain
said
brightly
Um
that
is
I
had
insurance
He
trailed
off
Sterno
caught
the
drift
You
don
t
have
insurance
any
more
Captain
Memory
looked
very
uncomfortable
Well
my
premiums
kind
of
went
up
Sterno
thought
for
a
moment
You
said
there
was
a
Luna
A
and
a
Luna
B
That
accounts
for
one
of
them
What
happened
to
the
other
one
Captain
Memory
fidgeted
Can
t
we
talk
about
something
else
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
So
are
you
going
to
be
flying
this
spaceship
Well
uh
no
the
Captain
began
Thank
Heavens
Sterno
broke
in
I
would
I
mean
I
could
Captain
Memory
continued
Just
as
soon
as
I
get
my
license
back
Sterno
sighed
So
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
wait
No
no
the
Captain
said
reassuringly
They
gave
me
a
pilot
Sterno
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
So
where
is
this
spaceship
Ernie
asked
excitedly
He
was
really
looking
forward
to
the
prospect
of
seeing
a
real
live
spaceship
I
left
it
parked
up
in
orbit
the
Captain
explained
Want
me
to
call
it
down
SURE
Okay
The
Captain
began
looking
around
Where
s
my
remote
control
I
had
it
here
a
minute
ago
Ernie
began
looking
around
as
well
What
does
it
look
like
Oh
it
s
about
so
Captain
Memory
motioned
with
his
hands
to
indicated
a
rectangle
about
six
inches
long
It
s
wrapped
in
white
paper
Ernie
began
to
feel
uneasy
What
color
was
it
Under
the
paper
that
is
The
Captain
was
still
looking
around
It
s
brown
and
kind
of
soft
The
Captain
looked
under
the
sofa
That
s
funny
Here
s
the
paper
from
it
but
it
s
all
crumpled
up
And
the
remote
is
gone
Ernie
began
to
get
a
real
bad
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
Um
was
it
by
any
chance
uh
chocolate
Well
sure
After
all
it
was
either
that
or
strawberry
The
Captain
laughed
I
couldn
t
very
well
have
a
strawberry
remote
could
I
Ernie
moaned
quietly
Uh
I
think
I
know
what
happened
to
it
Sterno
looked
at
Ernie
aghast
You
DIDN
T
Ernie
nodded
sadly
Sterno
turned
to
Captain
Memory
He
ATE
it
Captain
Memory
looked
at
Ernie
incredulously
How
could
you
EAT
a
remote
control
unit
Well
Ernie
was
embarrassed
Actually
it
was
pretty
good
Suddenly
a
disturbing
thought
occurred
to
him
Say
it
s
not
poison
or
anything
is
it
Captain
Memory
looked
thoughtful
I
don
t
know
nobody
s
ever
eaten
one
before
He
thought
a
moment
I
guess
we
ll
find
out
won
t
we
Ernie
moaned
quietly
Well
well
If
they
re
gonna
make
a
remote
control
unit
that
looks
like
a
candy
bar
they
ought
to
put
a
warning
on
it
or
something
They
did
Captain
Memory
answered
I
didn
t
see
any
warning
cried
Ernie
indignantly
All
I
saw
was
a
piece
of
blank
white
paper
That
s
the
warning
the
Captain
explained
It
means
Don
t
Eat
this
Remote
Control
Unit
in
Franglian
Franglian
You
know
like
they
speak
on
the
planet
Franglia
Captain
Memory
acted
as
though
this
were
perfectly
obvious
to
everyone
But
nobody
on
Earth
speaks
Franglian
Ernie
protested
Captain
Memory
considered
this
Well
then
I
guess
it
s
not
much
good
is
it
He
pulled
out
his
TV
Guide
Hey
you
wanna
watch
some
TV
Ernie
s
stomach
was
beginning
to
feel
very
bad
indeed
Actually
watching
TV
was
about
the
last
thing
he
wanted
to
do
but
considering
the
looks
everyone
was
giving
him
at
the
moment
he
thought
perhaps
he
had
just
better
keep
his
mouth
shut
The
Fly
and
Mr
Ed
returned
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
Mr
Ed
seemed
to
have
cheered
up
considerably
Hey
what
s
on
TV
the
Fly
asked
Captain
Memory
Let
me
see
the
Captain
leafed
through
the
pages
Wanna
watch
a
movie
How
about
Beach
Blanket
Chainsaw
Massacre
Irate
viewers
get
sick
of
aging
beach
stars
and
cut
them
up
with
power
tools
with
Frankie
Avalon
Annette
Funicello
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
Maybe
said
the
Fly
thoughtfully
What
else
is
on
You
like
horror
movies
said
the
Captain
How
about
Goldfish
from
Hell
Suburban
family
discovers
their
pet
is
possessed
by
evil
spirits
with
Flipper
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
Nah
said
the
Fly
I
don
t
like
horror
movies
How
about
Gidget
Goes
Berserk
Gidget
gets
a
chainsaw
for
Christmas
and
Oh
no
Sterno
broke
in
I
simply
cannot
tolerate
Gidget
movies
How
about
Kung
Fu
Tigers
Go
Hawaiian
with
Bruce
Lee
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
Ernie
noticed
something
odd
about
the
TV
listings
Say
doesn
t
it
seem
a
little
strange
that
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
are
in
all
these
different
movies
No
I
don
t
think
it
s
strange
at
all
drawled
Mr
Ed
Do
you
Sterno
glared
at
Ernie
After
all
YOU
VE
done
I
should
think
you
d
be
content
to
sit
quietly
and
mind
your
own
business
Hey
you
ll
like
this
Captain
Memory
said
to
the
Fly
Wanna
watch
the
Miss
Galaxy
Pageant
Sure
thing
the
Fly
enthused
Turn
it
on
Okay
I
ll
get
up
and
turn
it
on
I
ll
have
to
get
up
because
The
Captain
glared
at
Ernie
I
don
t
have
a
remote
Ernie
shrank
into
his
seat
The
Captain
turned
on
the
television
and
here
s
our
celebrity
judges
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
The
camera
panned
in
to
the
two
celebrities
That
s
odd
thought
Ernie
They
don
t
look
the
way
I
remember
them
I
don
t
recall
them
having
such
pointy
teeth
Oh
well
it
s
probably
just
the
lighting
or
something
Now
our
first
contestant
The
girls
began
parading
by
Ernie
noticed
that
the
girls
in
this
pageant
didn
t
look
quite
like
the
one
s
he
was
used
to
seeing
For
one
thing
they
were
all
a
lot
plumper
than
the
beauty
queens
at
home
None
of
them
seemed
to
have
much
personality
either
They
all
looked
sort
of
bovine
Isn
t
she
a
delicious
young
lady
the
announcer
was
saying
Look
at
those
scrumptious
legs
those
mouth
watering
shoulders
those
tender
juicy
thighs
Gee
these
girls
aren
t
very
cute
said
the
Fly
disappointed
Not
like
at
home
They
look
positively
delicious
to
me
commented
Mr
Ed
Ernie
looked
at
Mr
Ed
suspiciously
That
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
very
strange
comment
to
be
coming
from
a
horse
But
then
come
to
think
of
it
any
comment
was
strange
coming
from
a
horse
You
wanna
watch
something
else
Captain
Memory
asked
the
Fly
No
no
that
s
okay
said
the
Fly
quickly
I
m
sure
they
ll
get
better
The
pageant
continued
our
next
mouth
watering
contestant
The
camera
cut
to
the
celebrity
judges
They
seemed
to
be
drooling
slightly
A
little
forked
tongue
seemed
to
dart
in
and
out
of
their
mouths
Or
maybe
it
was
just
a
trick
of
the
light
Ernie
felt
uneasy
Beauty
pageants
at
home
weren
t
like
this
