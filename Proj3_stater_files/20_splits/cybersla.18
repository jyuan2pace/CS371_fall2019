going
to
needing
my
brain
after
all
Lucy
s
brow
furled
thoughtfully
She
looked
at
Ricky
He
shrugged
No
I
guess
you
might
as
well
just
keep
it
Ernie
sighed
in
relief
Lucy
continued
If
it
turns
out
we
need
it
after
all
we
ll
get
back
to
you
okay
Uh
yeah
Ernie
fidgeted
uncomfortably
He
had
hoped
that
the
problem
would
go
away
completely
but
that
seemed
to
be
too
much
to
expect
At
least
he
didn
t
have
to
worry
about
it
right
now
Lucy
opened
the
door
to
the
time
machine
She
waved
at
the
foursome
See
you
uh
later
Uh
earlier
She
looked
confused
She
turned
to
Ricky
Bye
he
said
and
ushered
Lucy
into
the
machine
The
door
closed
behind
them
Captain
Memory
yawned
He
was
finding
this
all
rather
boring
I
wonder
what
s
on
TV
he
mused
pulling
out
the
TV
guide
A
look
of
concern
came
over
his
face
Ernie
noticed
this
What
s
the
matter
It
s
the
programs
the
Captain
said
looking
distressed
They
ve
um
changed
Changed
Ernie
was
uncomprehending
Changed
how
Well
for
instance
the
Captain
explained
Instead
of
I
Love
Lucy
there
s
now
I
Wanna
Donna
starring
Donna
the
Iguana
and
her
husband
Ricky
the
Reptile
In
fact
Captain
Memory
flipped
through
the
pages
quickly
They
all
seem
to
be
Reptile
shows
Ernie
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
Oh
no
Now
instead
of
them
having
to
watch
our
shows
we
have
to
watch
THEIR
shows
Cm
continued
calmly
perusing
the
TV
Guide
Aside
from
that
they
re
pretty
much
the
same
The
plots
seem
to
be
about
the
same
He
chuckled
Oh
look
Here
s
the
episode
where
Ricky
Jr
hatches
Sterno
seemed
lost
in
thought
That
reptile
lady
s
name
wasn
t
really
Lucy
was
it
he
asked
the
psychiatrist
Oh
no
agreed
the
doctor
Dat
s
only
her
stage
name
Sterno
s
eyes
narrowed
Her
real
name
wouldn
t
by
any
chance
happen
to
be
He
paused
for
effect
DONNA
would
it
He
watched
the
psychiatrist
closely
The
doctor
fidgeted
uncomfortably
Uh
I
m
um
not
allowed
to
divulge
personal
information
about
Sterno
cut
him
off
Just
as
we
thought
Sterno
puffed
his
cigar
contemplatively
You
know
some
people
will
do
anything
to
get
into
show
biz
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
worriedly
I
don
t
know
if
I
m
going
to
like
watching
Reptile
shows
all
the
time
The
psychiatrist
regained
his
composure
Vith
every
successful
therapy
there
is
always
a
period
of
readjustment
for
ze
family
In
time
you
vill
learn
to
deal
vith
dis
new
situation
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Und
you
must
be
ze
one
vis
ze
amnesia
problem
The
Captain
looked
up
Who
me
Dat
s
right
the
psychiatrist
looked
at
him
intently
You
have
ze
amnesia
ja
Captain
Memory
looked
confused
Not
that
I
recall
Chust
as
ve
thought
the
doctor
said
triumphantly
scribbling
furiously
on
his
notepad
All
of
this
was
making
Ernie
very
uncomfortable
Hey
guys
he
whispered
to
the
others
I
think
maybe
we
ought
to
get
going
What
IS
your
problem
said
Sterno
loudly
Um
uh
Everyone
was
looking
at
Ernie
He
didn
t
know
what
to
say
The
Fly
looked
puzzled
Is
something
the
matter
Oh
don
t
pay
any
attention
to
him
scoffed
Sterno
gesturing
in
Ernie
s
direction
He
s
just
paranoid
I
am
not
said
Ernie
defensively
The
Fly
seemed
confused
Paranoids
never
admit
they
re
paranoid
explained
Sterno
Please
please
gentlemen
the
psychiatrist
broke
in
Ve
must
return
to
ze
topic
Everyone
vill
get
his
turn
to
speak
He
tuned
to
Ernie
reassuringly
Ve
must
not
allow
our
paranoia
to
carry
us
away
ja
He
smiled
It
seemed
to
Ernie
that
the
smile
wasn
t
very
friendly
But
then
he
thought
that
s
what
a
paranoid
would
think
Could
it
be
that
the
doctor
was
right
and
that
he
Ernie
had
become
paranoid
Ernie
didn
t
know
what
to
think
any
more
Zo
the
doctor
turned
again
to
Captain
Memory
You
vere
telling
us
about
your
computer
hacking
activities
ja
I
was
The
Captain
looked
puzzled
I
don
t
recall
that
Ernie
s
eyes
narrowed
He
didn
t
recall
that
either
Ja
ja
the
psychiatrist
said
reassuringly
Amnesia
is
a
terrible
thing
Ve
must
begin
your
therapy
right
avay
He
pulled
out
a
gold
pocket
watch
on
the
end
of
a
long
chain
and
began
swinging
it
slowly
back
and
forth
in
front
of
Captain
Memory
Vatch
de
vatch
he
whispered
to
the
Captain
Now
go
back
back
Vhat
do
you
remember
Captain
Memory
seemed
to
be
completely
hypnotized
It
s
it
s
so
confusing
Images
numbers
it
s
space
yes
Cyberspace
And
it
s
all
filled
with
strange
images
Games
pictures
old
movies
and
TV
shows
They
re
all
coming
at
me
All
at
the
same
time
They
re
filling
my
head
They
re
taking
over
my
brain
The
Captain
was
becoming
very
agitated
Relax
calm
yourself
the
psychiatrist
whispered
The
Captain
seemed
calmer
now
Go
back
further
back
Vhat
do
you
see
The
Captain
seemed
to
be
in
a
daze
Pyramids
Pharaohs
No
no
the
psychiatrist
protested
Not
THAT
far
back
I
knew
it
Ernie
broke
in
Ancient
Egypt
Please
the
doctor
snapped
glaring
at
Ernie
Do
not
interrupt
Your
time
vill
come
He
smiled
evilly
Or
on
the
other
hand
perhaps
Ernie
only
imagined
that
he
smiled
evilly
Maybe
he
was
really
trying
to
help
and
Ernie
s
paranoia
was
making
him
imagine
something
else
Ernie
just
didn
t
know
anymore
I
remember
breaking
out
of
an
egg
The
Fly
was
talking
now
He
too
seemed
to
be
in
a
daze
Oh
wow
thought
Ernie
The
Fly
must
have
been
watching
while
the
doctor
hypnotized
Captain
Memory
Now
he
s
hypnotized
too
The
psychiatrist
glared
at
the
Fly
Quiet
please
The
Fly
paid
no
attention
He
kept
on
talking
A
larva
That
s
it
I
m
a
larva
The
doctor
attempted
to
coax
more
from
Captain
Memory
Now
go
back
The
Fly
broke
in
again
I
m
a
larva
and
I
m
on
a
nice
warm
pile
of
garbage
Yes
The
psychiatrist
cursed
under
his
breath
He
turned
to
the
Fly
Wake
up
He
snapped
his
fingers
in
front
of
the
Fly
s
face
Both
the
Fly
and
Captain
Memory
awoke
instantly
The
Fly
put
his
hands
up
to
his
head
Oh
wow
he
said
uncertainly
I
must
have
dozed
off
Captain
Memory
yawned
That
s
funny
So
did
I
And
I
ve
been
having
the
strangest
dreams
The
doctor
turned
to
Captain
Memory
with
keen
interest
Zo
tell
me
about
zese
dreams
Captain
Memory
scratched
his
head
Well
I
was
in
Ancient
Egypt
and
I
He
trailed
off
Please
go
on
the
psychiatrist
urged
The
Captain
looked
confused
That
s
all
I
can
remember
The
doctor
cursed
again
He
suddenly
became
aware
that
Ernie
was
watching
him
He
cleared
his
throat
and
regained
his
composure
Zo
he
began
Now
ve
give
ze
other
patients
a
turn
The
doctor
turned
to
one
of
the
patients
that
had
been
in
the
room
when
the
foursome
arrived
the
depressed
looking
man
who
kept
wringing
his
hands
Why
don
t
you
tell
us
your
name
and
vhat
has
brought
you
to
see
us
today
The
other
patient
looked
somehow
familiar
to
Ernie
Vell
doctor
my
name
is
Holger
Horses
Und
mein
problem
vell
it
s
mein
job
He
continued
to
look
steadfastly
at
the
floor
never
once
looking
up
at
the
others
around
him
Ernie
thought
it
was
very
odd
that
this
patient
too
had
a
German
accent
But
then
on
the
other
hand
perhaps
he
was
just
being
paranoid
The
patient
went
on
Mein
boss
he
is
so
demanding
If
I
make
even
one
liddle
mistake
he
hits
me
vith
his
riding
crop
Und
if
I
don
t
make
any
mistake
he
hits
me
anyway
He
sniffled
He
seemed
about
to
cry
It
makes
me
feel
so
inadequate
There
there
said
the
doctor
commiseratingly
handing
the
man
a
handkerchief
The
man
blew
his
nose
noisily
I
mean
it
s
not
mein
fault
dat
they
keep
getting
avay
Ve
lock
them
up
good
But
somehow
dey
get
out
and
I
get
blamed
He
sniffled
Vhy
do
dey
keep
doing
dis
to
me
All
ve
vant
to
do
is
torture
dem
a
liddle
Oh
ja
ja
the
psychiatrist
said
compassionately
Ze
vorkplace
is
so
demanding
dese
days
I
understand
exactly
how
you
feel
Do
you
doctor
The
man
looked
up
hopefully
pleadingly
at
the
psychiatrist
Does
dat
mean
you
von
t
hit
me
vith
the
riding
crop
any
more
Dummkopf
the
psychiatrist
hissed
The
man
caught
his
breath
suddenly
and
looked
quickly
back
down
at
the
floor
He
began
to
moan
quietly
again
The
doctor
laughed
nervously
Vell
uh
perhaps
ve
had
best
go
on
to
ze
next
patient
He
turned
to
the
other
man
the
one
who
continuously
lit
matches
Und
your
name
sir
Vell
Herr
Doktor
mein
name
ist
Horst
Manure
the
man
continued
to
light
matches
as
he
talked
It
seemed
very
odd
to
Ernie
that
this
patient
too
spoke
with
a
German
accent
I
zee
said
the
psychiatrist
Und
vhen
did
you
first
notice
zis
fascination
vith
fire
The
patient
giggled
Vell
it
shtarted
vhen
Rome
burned
Flames
everywhere
The
whole
city
in
flames
People
running
screaming
It
was
chust
SO
much
fun
He
stared
fixedly
as
the
match
slowly
burned
down
to
his
fingertips
Ernie
couldn
t
help
interrupting
Wait
a
minute
How
could
you
be
old
enough
to
be
in
Rome
when
it
burned
The
patient
looked
taken
aback
He
looked
quickly
at
the
doctor
The
doctor
seemed
very
uncomfortable
Uh
um
ze
time
machine
Oh
yes
he
use
ze
time
machine
What
s
he
doing
with
a
time
machine
anyway
Ernie
demanded
The
psychiatrist
quickly
regained
his
poise
He
peered
at
Ernie
Zo
do
you
haff
zese
attacks
of
paranoia
often
Ernie
was
caught
off
guard
Um
uh
yes
Uh
I
mean
NO
He
was
becoming
very
confused
The
psychiatrist
nodded
knowingly
I
zee
Ernie
pouted
I
think
there
s
something
pretty
suspicious
about
this
whole
business
Of
course
you
do
Sterno
puffed
contentedly
on
his
cigar
You
re
paranoid
No
I
m
Ernie
began
Sterno
continued
cutting
Ernie
off
You
know
I
ve
always
suspected
as
much
But
now
that
we
have
the
doctor
s
diagnosis
we
know
for
sure
Something
occurred
to
Ernie
You
suspected
as
much
Yes
all
along
Sterno
maintained
smugly
Well
if
you
re
suspecting
things
than
maybe
YOU
RE
the
paranoid
Ernie
cried
out
triumphantly
Sterno
harrumphed
I
don
t
think
that
s
The
Fly
cut
him
off
Oh
I
get
it
it
s
a
game
right
His
antennae
waved
excitedly
It
s
Find
the
Paranoid
right
He
began
bouncing
up
and
down
in
his
seat
I
know
I
know
He
waved
his
hands
in
the
air
excitedly
making
incomprehensible
gestures
First
syllable
sounds
like
SHTOP
DIS
the
psychiatrist
screamed
angrily
From
out
of
nowhere
a
riding
crop
had
appeared
in
his
hand
He
was
about
to
lash
out
at
the
patient
nearest
him
when
he
noticed
that
everyone
was
looking
at
him
He
stopped
and
laughed
weakly
He
quickly
tossed
the
riding
crop
under
a
chair
and
tried
to
regain
his
composure
Zo
uh
where
vere
ve
Ernie
s
eyes
narrowed
accusingly
You
had
a
riding
crop
The
Fly
bounced
up
and
down
excitedly
Oh
wow
He
had
a
riding
crop
He
s
not
supposed
to
have
that
He
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
the
psychiatrist
Personal
foul
Lose
yards
Do
not
pass
Go
do
NOT
collect
He
folded
his
arms
triumphantly
The
doctor
smiled
weakly
Uh
I
can
explain
I
bid
twenty
the
Fly
interrupted
Three
strikes
and
you
re
out
Ernie
noticed
a
framed
diploma
hanging
on
the
wall
behind
him
He
turned
to
read
it
He
looked
at
the
diploma
and
then
at
the
doctor
and
then
at
the
diploma
again
Hey
guys
he
called
out
to
the
others
excitedly
Do
you
know
who
this
doctor
is
He
s
Dr
Heinz
von
Lie
ENOUGH
The
psychiatrist
slammed
a
riding
crop
against
the
seat
of
an
empty
chair
commanding
everyone
s
attention
Ernie
that
the
first
riding
crop
was
still
under
an
empty
chair
where
the
doctor
had
thrown
it
He
appeared
to
have
an
endless
supply
of
them
All
right
He
took
off
the
thin
pince
nez
glasses
he
had
been
wearing
tossed
them
aside
and
replaced
them
with
a
monocle
Zo
you
haff
discovered
my
true
identity
eh
He
laughed
evilly
Ernie
was
pretty
sure
that
the
doctor
really
was
laughing
evilly
that
he
wasn
t
just
imagining
it
It
does
not
matter
von
Liederkranz
continued
The
interrogation
will
proceed
The
Fly
was
confused
Interrogation
I
thought
it
was
therapy
Interrogation
therapy
what
difference
does
it
make
the
Nazi
answered
It
s
all
ze
same
thing
Ernie
pointed
indignantly
at
Sterno
See
And
you
thought
I
was
paranoid
You
were
wrong
I
was
not
Sterno
declared
defensively
I
still
think
you
re
paranoid
But
Ernie
was
totally
taken
aback
Just
because
he
s
really
a
Nazi
doesn
t
mean
you
re
not
paranoid
Sterno
continued
self
importantly
Even
paranoids
have
enemies
Ernie
could
only
sputter
with
indignation
The
Fly
looked
at
the
Nazi
accusingly
You
said
you
were
a
psychiatrist
We
trusted
you
Ach
but
I
am
Huh
The
Fly
was
confused
The
Nazi
explained
I
told
you
I
am
Sturmbannfuhrer
Doktor
Heinz
von
Liederkranz
Und
vot
kind
of
doctor
did
you
tink
I
vas
Sterno
puffed
thoughtfully
on
his
cigar
That
DOES
make
sense
he
admitted
After
all
if
a
Nazi
torturer
were
going
to
be
a
doctor
then
a
psychiatrist
would
be
the
one
to
be
Precisely
von
Liederkranz
agreed
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
agitatedly
You
re
not
going
to
torture
us
are
you
Oh
no
laughed
von
Liederkranz
Ve
don
t
do
dat
anymore
Dat
s
barbaric
The
Fly
sighed
with
relief
Now
ve
have
psychiatry
the
Nazi
smiled
evilly
It
s
MUCH
worse
Ernie
began
edging
slowly
towards
the
door
Don
t
bother
the
psychiatrist
called
out
It
s
locked
Ernie
lunged
for
the
door
anyway
No
one
made
a
move
to
stop
him
The
door
was
solid
steel
and
securely
locked
Ernie
glumly
returned
to
his
seat
Von
Liederkranz
turned
to
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
hadn
t
been
paying
much
attention
to
the
proceedings
He
was
still
engrossed
in
the
TV
Guide
He
appeared
to
be
diligently
searching
for
something
to
watch
other
than
Reptile
shows
The
Nazi
smiled
malevolently
Zo
you
didn
t
like
ze
Hot
Vhirling
Corkscrew
eh
Captain
Memory
looked
up
annoyedly
Not
THAT
again
Von
Liederkranz
laughed
diabolically
Oh
no
of
COURSE
not
Ve
have
something
heh
heh
MUCH
vorse
He
peered
closely
at
the
Captain
Your
mother
never
liked
you
he
announced
Captain
Memory
s
eyes
went
wide
with
shock
Aaugghh
he
screamed
burying
his
head
in
his
arms
The
Nazi
chuckled
sadistically
I
told
you
psychiatry
is
MUCH
vorse
Und
much
more
effective
Ernie
noticed
that
the
Nazi
had
discarded
his
cigar
and
was
now
holding
a
cigarette
in
a
long
holder
Now
vill
you
tell
us
how
you
gain
access
to
the
system
Poor
Captain
Memory
could
only
whimper
Von
Liederkranz
didn
t
seem
to
mind
that
the
Captain
refused
to
talk
It
gave
him
more
opportunity
to
practice
his
sadistic
psychiatry
Very
vell
he
smirked
You
asked
for
it
He
peered
intently
at
the
Captain
choosing
his
words
carefully
You
re
totally
inadequate
NO
screamed
Captain
Memory
curling
himself
up
into
a
tight
ball
Heh
heh
the
Nazi
chuckled
He
looked
closely
at
Captain
Memory
preparing
his
next
shot
You
re
The
Captain
couldn
t
take
any
more
Uh
C
D
C
he
cried
Suddenly
the
scene
vanished
Ernie
staggered
with
vertigo
and
sat
down
heavily
on
the
ground
His
eyes
stung
as
a
gust
of
wind
blew
sand
in
his
face
His
head
swam
and
he
felt
nauseous
He
closed
his
eyes
tightly
and
put
a
hand
over
his
stomach
I
think
I
m
getting
the
flu
he
moaned
After
a
few
moments
he
opened
his
eyes
carefully
wiping
the
sand
out
of
them
At
first
all
he
could
see
was
sand
Then
he
looked
up
and
saw
The
Pyramids
Ernie
breathed
in
awe
CHAPTER
Ernie
looked
around
The
Fly
was
sitting
in
the
sand
attempting
to
make
sand
castles
Sterno
was
prowling
around
the
sand
obviously
looking
for
something
Captain
Memory
was
still
curled
up
in
a
ball
Ernie
struggled
to
his
feet
and
attempted
to
brush
some
of
the
sand
off
himself
He
walked
over
to
where
the
Captain
lay
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
You
can
come
out
now
He
s
gone
Captain
Memory
peeked
out
tentatively
He
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
and
uncurled
sitting
up
in
the
sand
Whew
I
m
glad
that
s
over
That
was
awful
The
Fly
peered
at
Captain
Memory
curiously
That
stuff
he
was
saying
was
it
true
I
mean
like
about
your
mother
and
everything
The
Captain
looked
puzzled
Um
actually
I
can
t
quite
recall
But
if
it
had
been
it
would
have
been
pretty
awful
wouldn
t
it
Wow
said
the
Fly
in
agreement
He
thought
a
moment
And
what
about
that
stuff
about
being
totally
inad
I
don
t
want
to
talk
about
it
The
Captain
cut
him
off
irritatedly
Ernie
looked
up
and
once
again
beheld
the
majesty
of
the
Pyramids
in
the
distance
They
looked
a
lot
newer
than
he
remembered
them
Wow
he
breathed
We
must
be
in
Ancient
Egypt
right
Captain
Memory
looked
perplexed
Um
well
I
could
be
wrong
but
I
think
we
re
on
a
beach
in
New
Jersey
Ah
well
Sterno
chimed
in
still
sifting
through
the
sand
That
explains
all
these
cigarette
butts
and
ring
pull
tabs
Ernie
stared
at
him
What
are
you
doing
I
seem
to
have
dropped
my
lighter
Sterno
explained
You
haven
t
seen
it
have
you
Ernie
looked
around
Afraid
not
It
s
so
difficult
to
find
anything
in
this
shifting
sand
Sterno
stopped
and
picked
up
something
Here
s
a
penny
Oh
yeah
This
might
be
a
clue
to
they
re
location
Ernie
thought
What
kind
is
it
A
Lincoln
Sterno
turned
the
penny
over
No
a
Cadillac
Ernie
scratched
his
head
Well
that
s
close
I
guess
What
s
the
date
one
it
Sterno
examined
it
closely
B
C
Ernie
s
face
lit
up
Oh
that
explains
why
the
Pyramids
look
new
He
frowned
But
what
are
the
Pyramids
doing
on
a
beach
in
New
Jersey
I
ve
got
it
Sterno
cried
You
do
asked
Ernie
in
amazement
Great
What
He
stopped
Sterno
was
holding
a
small
object
triumphantly
aloft
I
ve
found
it
I
He
stopped
Wait
a
minute
This
isn
t
my
lighter
It
s
just
an
old
BIC
He
flicked
it
A
small
flame
appeared
Oh
well
he
sighed
I
suppose
it
ll
have
to
do
He
placed
it
in
his
invisible
pocket
Ernie
looked
at
the
Pyramids
again
Uh
anyway
as
I
was
saying
Captain
Memory
sighed
loudly
What
s
the
matter
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
It
s
a
real
bad
sign
when
you
get
Pyramids
showing
up
on
a
beach
in
New
Jersey
Bad
sign
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
nervously
Captain
Memory
sighed
Yeah
It
means
that
the
fabric
of
Cyberspace
is
coming
apart
We
re
getting
really
close
to
that
final
total
sys
Don
t
say
it
Ernie
pleaded
tem
Captain
Memory
continued
Please
Ernie
begged
The
Captain
stopped
Why
not
Ernie
moaned
It
makes
my
stomach
hurt
Captain
Memory
just
shrugged
Ernie
moaned
again
Hey
guy
the
Fly
chimed
in
He
took
a
small
package
out
of
one
of
his
suit
pockets
and
handed
it
to
Ernie
Here
s
what
you
need
Have
some
Rolaids
Oh
Thanks
Ernie
tried
a
few
Actually
they
did
seem
to
help
Well
maybe
a
total
system
failure
wasn
t
that
bad
after
all
So
what
do
you
wanna
do
now
guys
the
Fly
piped
up
brightly
Beats
me
answered
Captain
Memory
Haven
t
the
foggiest
replied
Sterno
absently
He
was
engrossed
in
trying
to
light
a
cigar
using
the
tiny
flame
from
the
old
BIC
Ernie
looked
around
I
dunno
What
do
you
wanna
do
Wanna
go
see
an
ancient
undiscovered
tomb
That
sounds
like
fun
huh
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
expectantly
Oh
let
s
answered
Sterno
brightly
He
was
in
a
much
better
mood
now
that
he
d
gotten
his
cigar
going
Ernie
frowned
How
do
you
know
where
to
find
an
ancient
undiscovered
tomb
Simple
the
Fly
replied
cheerfully
Just
follow
the
signs
He
pointed
to
an
object
in
the
distance
Ernie
peered
in
the
direction
the
Fly
was
pointing
Sure
enough
he
could
just
barely
make
out
a
sign
which
said
THIS
WAY
TO
THE
ANCIENT
UNDISCOVERED
TOMB
with
an
arrow
pointing
the
way
Well
Ernie
