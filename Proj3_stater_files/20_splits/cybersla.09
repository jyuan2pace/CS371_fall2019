All
Building
and
even
there
only
after
P
M
on
weekends
It
does
seem
suspicious
Ernie
was
thrilled
that
for
once
someone
agreed
with
him
Okay
well
that
proves
it
right
So
let
s
get
out
of
here
okay
I
ve
got
it
cried
Captain
Memory
He
grabbed
a
pen
and
wrote
in
large
childlike
block
letters
in
the
space
marked
Serial
Number
FROSTED
FLAKES
There
he
said
beaming
He
looked
at
the
next
line
and
his
face
fell
Oh
it
s
an
essay
question
I
hate
essay
questions
So
let
s
get
out
of
here
okay
Ernie
urged
He
felt
more
uneasy
with
each
passing
moment
Captain
Memory
sighed
I
guess
we
might
as
well
I
m
never
gonna
finish
this
thing
He
pushed
the
pile
of
papers
aside
Ernie
began
slowly
heading
toward
the
door
acutely
aware
of
all
the
clerks
watching
him
He
tried
to
act
as
nonchalant
as
possible
whistling
a
little
tune
and
shuffling
his
feet
as
he
walked
Just
a
minute
he
heard
the
old
woman
clerk
cry
out
Just
WHERE
do
you
think
you
re
going
Uh
uh
Ernie
stammered
Don
t
you
know
you
re
not
allowed
to
leave
without
filling
out
a
Form
Application
for
Authorization
to
Apply
for
Permission
for
an
Interruption
in
Completion
of
Forms
she
shrieked
Get
back
here
Ernie
thought
fast
Uh
I
gotta
go
to
the
bathroom
The
old
woman
glared
at
the
other
three
And
what
about
YOU
The
others
followed
Ernie
s
lead
Uh
we
all
gotta
go
to
the
bathroom
they
chorused
in
unison
The
clerk
scowled
All
right
Fill
out
this
Form
Request
for
Permission
to
Apply
for
Authorization
for
Admission
to
the
Sanitary
Facility
she
snapped
Anyway
you
re
going
the
wrong
way
The
bathroom
s
that
way
She
pointed
down
a
long
corridor
which
seemed
to
disappear
into
the
bowels
of
the
building
Ernie
looked
at
the
others
RUN
he
yelled
They
all
sprinted
for
the
door
Stop
them
shrieked
the
old
woman
but
they
were
already
through
the
door
Outside
they
found
themselves
on
the
dingy
streets
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
large
city
greatly
in
need
of
urban
renewal
We
d
better
keep
moving
Ernie
urged
They
re
right
behind
us
The
Fly
looked
back
No
they
re
not
Ernie
stopped
confused
and
turned
around
Sure
enough
there
was
no
sign
of
pursuit
Why
aren
t
they
chasing
us
Ernie
wondered
Oh
here
s
the
reason
said
Captain
Memory
regarding
his
bare
wrist
It
s
five
o
clock
Civil
servants
never
work
past
five
He
continued
to
regard
his
bare
wrist
I
d
really
like
to
get
a
watch
Ernie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
So
we
re
safe
then
At
least
till
nine
o
clock
tomorrow
morning
Captain
Memory
agreed
He
looked
around
brightly
Let
s
go
for
a
walk
Maybe
we
can
find
a
jewelry
store
somewhere
around
here
Captain
Memory
paused
reflectively
looking
at
his
bare
wrist
It
doesn
t
have
to
be
a
Rolex
A
Seiko
would
be
okay
Of
course
I
wouldn
t
mind
a
Rolex
They
began
strolling
down
the
street
As
they
neared
the
corner
they
began
to
hear
music
in
the
distance
Ernie
recognized
the
sound
of
steel
drums
and
guitars
Reggae
he
said
Somebody
s
playing
reggae
music
around
here
Ernie
relaxed
While
he
wasn
t
a
particular
fan
of
reggae
music
it
made
him
fell
more
at
home
to
come
across
anything
at
all
he
could
recognize
As
they
turned
the
corner
they
came
upon
a
group
of
black
people
who
seemed
to
be
having
a
party
They
wore
bright
colored
clothes
and
had
their
hair
hanging
down
in
long
braids
Dreadlocks
Ernie
recognized
They
must
be
Rastafarians
The
Fly
seemed
totally
confused
by
these
people
Hey
guy
he
said
to
one
of
them
Uh
do
you
live
around
here
Oh
no
mon
the
man
answered
in
a
thick
Jamaican
accent
We
not
from
here
mon
We
from
de
Islands
We
Rastas
In
spite
of
himself
Ernie
found
himself
becoming
suspicious
For
one
thing
they
didn
t
look
like
other
black
people
Ernie
knew
There
was
something
funny
about
their
skin
tone
It
was
unusually
black
and
it
seemed
to
be
coming
off
on
objects
around
them
Out
of
a
corner
of
his
eye
Ernie
noticed
a
trash
can
nearby
It
seemed
to
be
full
of
empty
bottles
of
black
shoe
polish
Another
of
the
Rastafarians
approached
the
Fly
Hey
brother
he
said
pointing
at
the
Fly
s
antenna
You
got
de
dreadlocks
too
I
see
Here
smoke
some
of
dis
ganja
He
handed
the
Fly
a
funny
looking
cigarette
Uh
thanks
The
Fly
accepted
the
cigarette
However
he
couldn
t
seem
to
fit
it
into
his
snout
no
matter
which
way
he
held
it
Ernie
heard
the
reassuring
strains
of
Bob
Marley
and
the
Wailers
drifting
out
through
a
nearby
doorway
but
he
was
unable
to
shake
his
suspicions
He
noticed
something
unusual
about
the
man
s
footwear
Since
when
do
Rastas
wear
jackboots
The
man
seemed
momentarily
nonplussed
but
quickly
recovered
his
composure
Oh
sure
mon
We
all
wear
de
jackboots
now
It
s
de
new
in
thing
He
turned
to
the
Fly
Ain
t
dat
right
brother
The
Fly
had
managed
to
get
a
grip
on
the
cigarette
with
his
snout
and
was
puffing
away
He
started
to
giggle
Jackboots
Sure
Why
not
Dere
you
go
mon
the
Rasta
said
reassuringly
while
taking
out
a
monocle
and
fitting
it
into
his
eye
You
got
nothin
to
worry
about
We
just
Rastas
mon
We
not
Nazis
or
nothin
He
laughed
Oh
no
The
Fly
was
giggling
uncontrollably
now
Hey
that
s
GREAT
music
he
said
enthusiastically
You
guys
are
really
alright
This
is
FUN
He
broke
down
into
fits
of
hysterical
giggling
Take
it
easy
mon
the
Rasta
said
to
Ernie
My
name
s
Jack
I
from
Monterey
Dey
call
me
Monterey
Jack
Sterno
stiffened
Monterey
Jack
Do
you
know
what
that
is
he
hissed
It
s
it
s
CHEESE
The
Rasta
stood
abruptly
up
the
monocle
dropping
out
of
his
eye
SEIZE
THEM
he
shrieked
his
Islands
accent
abruptly
vanishing
RUN
shouted
Ernie
and
Sterno
together
Hey
guys
what
s
the
rush
asked
the
Fly
his
head
lolling
from
side
to
side
Isn
t
this
a
FUN
party
Come
ON
Ernie
grabbed
the
Fly
s
tie
and
pulled
him
along
like
a
puppy
on
a
leash
The
ran
down
the
narrow
street
the
Fly
stumbling
and
giggling
Close
behind
them
were
the
imitation
Rastas
discarding
their
Caribbean
clothes
as
they
ran
to
reveal
Nazi
uniforms
beneath
Quick
in
here
Ernie
pulled
the
Fly
into
an
open
doorway
followed
by
Sterno
and
Captain
Memory
Inside
was
a
flight
of
stairs
They
ran
up
the
stairs
and
through
a
door
at
the
first
landing
to
find
themselves
in
a
long
corridor
lined
by
rows
of
doors
Looks
like
an
apartment
building
or
maybe
a
hotel
Ernie
observed
Maybe
we
can
find
a
room
to
hide
in
Good
idea
Sterno
agreed
I
d
like
a
room
with
a
TV
if
you
don
t
mind
Captain
Memory
added
Ernie
glared
at
him
and
hurried
down
the
hall
still
dragging
the
Fly
by
the
necktie
An
open
door
beckoned
The
four
rushed
into
what
appeared
to
be
an
ordinary
somewhat
run
down
hotel
room
slammed
the
door
behind
them
and
locked
it
Whew
Ernie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Well
I
don
t
think
they
can
find
us
in
here
Look
s
like
we
re
safe
The
Fly
collapsed
into
an
overstuffed
chair
He
held
his
hands
up
in
front
of
his
face
Oh
wow
he
said
wonderingly
Did
you
ever
look
at
your
hands
I
mean
really
LOOK
at
them
He
started
giggling
again
Hmmph
Sterno
sniffed
Some
people
just
can
t
hold
their
ganja
There
was
a
knock
on
the
door
Ssh
Ernie
cautioned
the
others
Let
s
just
be
quiet
and
they
won
t
know
we
re
in
here
Ve
know
you
re
in
dere
a
voice
outside
the
door
shouted
Ernie
was
astonished
How
could
they
know
we
were
in
here
he
whispered
to
the
others
Dat
s
easy
answered
the
voice
from
behind
them
door
Ve
just
follow
ze
trail
of
sequins
Ernie
looked
at
his
toreador
suit
Large
sparkle
less
patches
confirmed
his
worst
fears
Sure
enough
a
faint
but
clearly
identifiable
trail
of
sequins
led
under
the
door
Ernie
became
aware
of
everyone
glaring
at
him
except
of
course
the
Fly
who
was
still
busily
examining
his
hands
You
again
snarled
Sterno
Well
hey
Ernie
shrugged
defensively
What
am
I
supposed
to
do
you
know
I
The
knock
sounded
again
this
time
louder
Open
up
Ernie
looked
at
the
door
I
ll
be
cool
about
this
he
decided
Maybe
I
can
fake
them
out
Uh
yes
he
called
out
brightly
Who
s
there
Nazis
came
the
reply
Open
up
Uh
no
thanks
We
don
t
want
any
You
vill
open
zis
door
NOW
Ernie
thought
fast
Uh
I
m
in
the
bathroom
right
now
Could
you
come
back
later
BREAK
DOWN
ZE
DOOR
Something
large
and
heavy
thudded
into
the
door
Ernie
looked
around
the
room
frantically
The
fire
escape
Ernie
pointed
through
an
open
window
Quick
Everybody
Out
that
way
The
ran
to
the
window
and
climbed
down
the
fire
escape
Ernie
pulling
the
Fly
by
the
necktie
Hey
what
s
the
rush
guys
asked
the
Fly
giggling
We
just
got
here
As
they
hurried
down
the
fire
escape
Ernie
heard
the
sound
of
the
door
breaking
down
behind
them
After
zem
a
voice
cried
The
bottom
of
the
fire
escape
led
to
a
narrow
alley
Hurrying
along
it
the
found
themselves
facing
a
large
iron
door
There
was
no
other
way
out
of
the
alley
The
sounds
of
pursuit
were
close
behind
them
Ernie
tried
the
doorknob
It
was
unlocked
Quick
through
here
he
shouted
They
four
scrambled
through
the
door
and
slammed
it
behind
them
Inside
it
was
totally
dark
Ernie
felt
along
the
doorframe
for
a
lock
He
found
one
and
locked
it
He
found
another
and
locked
that
too
There
was
also
a
large
bolt
and
a
huge
padlock
He
locked
those
as
well
There
he
said
That
should
keep
them
out
We
re
safe
now
He
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Where
are
we
he
heard
Captain
Memory
s
voice
ask
I
can
t
see
a
thing
Ernie
inched
carefully
forward
his
hands
outstretched
hoping
to
find
a
lamp
or
a
light
switch
or
something
Suddenly
from
out
of
the
darkness
a
voice
rang
out
Ah
how
nice
of
you
to
return
the
voice
said
Ve
haff
been
vaiting
for
you
Uh
oh
Ernie
began
I
think
we
re
in
trouble
guys
The
now
familiar
voice
of
the
game
show
announcer
boomed
out
You
sure
are
because
it
s
time
for
WHEEL
OF
TORTURE
There
was
the
sound
of
tremendous
applause
The
entire
scene
erupted
into
blinding
light
The
announcer
continued
And
now
for
our
first
contestant
from
Toledo
Ohio
it
s
Goombah
the
Toreador
My
name
s
Ernie
Ernie
complained
Gimme
a
break
huh
SURE
the
announcer
agreed
cheerfully
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
LIKE
BROKEN
Ernie
heard
uproarious
laughter
Say
the
announcer
continued
I
just
LOVE
your
suit
You
re
missing
a
few
sequins
though
Ernie
heard
laughter
again
this
time
cut
short
in
a
very
artificial
sounding
way
His
eyes
were
beginning
to
adjust
to
the
light
but
he
still
couldn
t
see
clearly
And
here
s
our
second
contestant
from
Des
Moines
Iowa
it
s
Seth
Brundage
the
Human
Fly
Aw
I
wish
you
wouldn
t
call
me
that
the
Fly
complained
It
makes
a
real
bad
impression
you
know
Couldn
t
you
just
call
me
Seth
Sure
thing
Mr
Fly
the
announcer
agreed
jovially
The
Fly
moaned
And
I
m
not
from
Des
Moines
either
Ernie
s
vision
was
beginning
to
clear
up
They
were
unfortunately
back
on
the
stage
of
Wheel
of
Torture
They
seemed
to
have
blundered
or
been
maneuvered
into
the
same
stage
they
had
escaped
from
twice
before
Ernie
just
hoped
they
would
be
able
to
escape
from
it
again
He
looked
out
towards
the
audience
There
was
no
audience
just
empty
chairs
Ernie
looked
around
There
were
no
guards
no
chorus
girls
In
fact
there
was
only
one
person
the
Gestapo
s
greatest
Sturmbannfuhrer
Dr
Heinz
von
Liederkranz
the
man
whose
name
sounds
like
cheese
Ernie
heard
thunderous
applause
Tank
you
tank
you
von
Liederkranz
bowed
in
the
direction
of
the
non
existent
audience
He
then
reached
out
and
shut
off
a
small
tape
recorder
The
applause
ended
abruptly
He
turned
on
another
small
tape
recorder
And
now
on
with
the
show
the
recorded
voice
of
the
announcer
rang
out
Von
Liederkranz
shut
that
one
off
too
Zo
ve
meet
again
Von
Liederkranz
smiled
unpleasantly
Now
you
are
in
my
power
You
vill
tell
me
vhat
I
vant
to
know
Ernie
looked
at
the
empty
chairs
What
happened
to
the
audience
Von
Liederkranz
s
face
turned
hard
Dat
vas
most
unfortunate
Dey
all
refused
to
confess
und
I
vas
forced
to
eliminate
dem
For
vhich
He
looked
around
quickly
Finding
no
one
else
around
him
he
settled
on
Ernie
YOU
vill
pay
schweinhund
he
cried
slapping
Ernie
with
his
riding
crop
Why
me
cried
Ernie
I
didn
t
SILENCE
Von
Liederkranz
eyed
them
all
suspiciously
Unfortunately
I
vill
not
be
able
to
interrogate
you
at
de
moment
due
to
a
um
temporary
staff
shortage
Until
zis
situation
can
be
remedied
I
vill
be
forced
to
keep
you
locked
up
Zis
time
however
you
vill
not
escape
due
to
ze
incompetence
of
guards
Ze
guards

been
liquidated
He
smiled
evilly
Now
you
vill
go
behind
Door
Nummer
One
MARSCH
He
gestured
at
them
with
an
evil
looking
weapon
The
foursome
found
themselves
herded
through
Door
Number
One
which
crashed
shut
behind
them
with
a
very
loud
and
ominous
clang
Ernie
looked
around
his
eyes
slowly
becoming
accustomed
to
the
darkness
They
seemed
to
be
back
in
the
same
large
dungeon
cell
they
had
been
held
in
before
The
room
was
dimly
lit
by
a
torch
attached
to
one
wall
The
far
reaches
of
the
room
disappeared
into
the
darkness
making
it
impossible
to
tell
exactly
how
big
the
cell
was
Oh
man
the
Fly
complained
Not
here
again
This
place
is
no
fun
I
waited
for
my
date
in
here
for
DAYS
man
She
never
showed
up
I
couldn
t
even
get
a
drink
while
I
waited
The
service
in
here
is
terrible
He
peered
into
the
darkness
Waiter
Waiter
He
sighed
It
doesn
t
do
any
good
Nobody
ever
comes
Ernie
peered
into
the
darkness
No
he
couldn
t
see
anything
that
even
remotely
resembled
a
waiter
However
straining
his
ears
he
did
seem
to
hear
something
It
sounded
like
sniffling
and
perhaps
crying
Who
s
there
he
called
into
the
darkness
Two
small
figures
began
to
approach
into
the
light
As
they
approached
Ernie
could
see
that
they
were
children
a
little
boy
and
a
little
girl
They
were
both
dressed
in
German
national
costumes
The
girl
was
wearing
a
dirndl
and
the
boy
was
wearing
lederhosen
and
a
little
alpine
hat
They
both
seemed
very
sad
Ernie
was
surprised
Hi
there
he
said
to
the
little
boy
in
a
kindly
manner
What
s
your
name
My
name
is
Hansel
said
the
boy
with
a
heavy
German
accent
Und
dis
is
my
sister
Gretel
The
Fly
regarded
the
children
Say
you
kids
haven
t
seen
my
date
have
you
She
s
about
five
foot
two
eyes
of
blue
The
children
looked
at
him
uncomprehendingly
The
Fly
sighed
Oh
well
it
was
worth
a
try
Ernie
regarded
the
children
with
amazement
How
did
you
kids
get
here
Hansel
sniffled
sadly
Ve

Gestapo
he
explained
Ve

He

Well

Captain
Memory
added
in
brightly
It
could
be
worse
How
asked
Hansel
innocently
Uh
Captain
Memory
thought
for
a
moment

He
fell
silent
Hansel
whimpered
It

Ernie
winced
Oh

Ernie
tried
to

to

Uh

Hansel
brightened
Oh

The

up

The
Captain
seemed
confused
Well

the
Fly

down
excitedly
Tell

excitedly
Tell

seemed

Well

Hansel
reassuringly
You

And
he
laughed
We

Gestapo
agents
Gretel
laughed
too
Oh

Gestapo
agents

How

Hansel

at
Gretel
See

brightly

fumed
Talk

Or

He
noticed
Gretel
glaring
at

He
caught
himself
Oh

He
laughed
feebly
You

how

JUMP
from

Sterno
looked
at
the
children
suspiciously
There

something
very
peculiar
about
these
children
he
remarked
He
looked
them
up
and
down
carefully
You

he
demanded
What

LAST

Hansel
and
Gretel
looked
at
each
other
in
confusion
Our
what
You

name
Sterno
insisted
Your
first

and
Gretel
what

names
Even

names
Hansel
and
Gretel
put
their
heads
together
and
began
whispering
furiously
between
them
Last

A

Dummkopf

Hansel
shrieked
back

You

Suddenly
the
door
to
the
dungeon
cell
flew
open
Von
Liederkranz
stood
in
the
doorway
framed
in
light
Zo
he
said
menacingly
My
liddle
subterfuge

not
fool

Dot

unfortunate
Now

Out
The
entire
group
stepped
out
of
the
dungeon
cell
and
back
onto
the
stage
of
WHEEL
OF
TORTURE
Von
Liederkranz
turned
to
Hansel
and
Gretel
Und

YOU
They
winced
Such

MARSCH
Von
Liederkranz
gestured
toward
the
door
with
his
evil
looking
weapon
The
midgets
filed
sadly
through
the
door
which
slammed
shut
behind
them
Ernie
heard
two
piercing
blood
curdling
screams
and
then
silence
Shaken
he
turned
to
Captain
Memory
What

is
behind
Door
Number
Four
The
Captain
shook
his
head
sadly
You

thought
for
a
moment
and
