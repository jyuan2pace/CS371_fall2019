he
said
enthusiastically
I
like
the
suit
It
s
the
new
in
thing
right
Sterno
regarded
Ernie
critically
Why
are
you
still
carrying
that
ridiculous
plastic
broadsword
Ernie
shifted
uncomfortably
Hey
I
told
you
it
s
a
forty
buck
deposit
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
Hopeless
Ernie
sat
down
in
a
comfortable
looking
chair
He
thought
he
had
better
take
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
rest
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
how
long
all
of
this
craziness
was
going
to
continue
So
like
what
s
with
that
Lucy
chick
the
Fly
asked
Captain
Memory
I
mean
like
what
s
her
problem
Oh
she
s
an
alien
explained
the
Captain
A
what
You
know
the
Captain
went
on
Come
from
outer
space
invade
the
Earth
steal
your
brain
that
kinda
stuff
The
Captain
made
himself
comfortable
on
a
small
sofa
and
began
leafing
through
his
copy
of
the
TV
Guide
Aliens
Ernie
asked
confusedly
Are
they
really
aliens
There
as
real
as
anything
in
Cyberspace
I
suppose
the
Captain
commented
But
what
are
they
DOING
here
Ernie
wanted
to
know
They
re
part
of
a
game
called
MENACE
FROM
PLANET
ZERO
It
s
quite
popular
the
Captain
explained
I
figured
we
d
run
across
it
sooner
or
later
With
all
the
systems
Waldo
s
been
taking
over
the
odds
are
that
it
d
be
in
at
least
one
of
them
The
Fly
seemed
a
bit
skeptical
Well
gee
that
chick
sure
didn
t
look
like
an
alien
The
Captain
was
impatient
She
s
in
disguise
of
course
You
wouldn
t
want
to
see
what
she
really
looks
like
He
shuddered
Anyway
he
continued
That
whole
bunch
are
aliens
in
disguise
They
ve
been
watching
our
s
TV
shows
and
they
think
those
TV
characters
are
normal
Earth
people
They
think
if
they
disguise
themselves
as
s
TV
characters
you
Earth
people
will
never
know
the
difference
They
don
t
seem
to
be
very
smart
Ernie
commented
Well
you
know
said
the
Captain
thoughtfully
Intelligence
is
not
the
only
way
to
approach
reality
There
are
other
ways
of
thinking
It
s
possible
to
approach
problem
solving
from
an
entirely
different
perspective
There
are
civilizations
in
which
thinking
is
done
in
an
entirely
different
way
where
intelligence
is
replaced
by
a
whole
different
way
of
looking
at
the
universe
Ernie
had
never
heard
Captain
Memory
get
so
philosophical
before
So
do
these
aliens
have
a
completely
different
way
of
thinking
he
asked
wonderingly
No
said
the
Captain
reflectively
They
re
just
stupid
He
returned
to
his
TV
Guide
I
mighta
known
said
the
Fly
reflectively
After
all
she
s
hanging
out
with
that
Ricky
guy
Man
he
s
something
else
Anybody
who
d
wear
a
shirt
like
that
He
trailed
off
looking
sideways
at
Ernie
A
number
of
magazines
were
scattered
about
an
end
table
next
to
Ernie
s
chair
A
headline
in
one
of
the
caught
Ernie
s
eye
FANTASTIC
ARCHAEOLOGICAL
FIND
REVEALED
Ernie
picked
it
up
and
began
to
read
On
October
an
Arab
shepherd
following
a
stray
animal
into
a
cave
near
the
Sea
of
Galilee
made
an
incredible
find
a
find
unparalleled
in
modern
history
A
find
so
monumental
so
earth
shattering
so
threatening
to
world
governments
and
religious
institutions
that
its
very
existence
has
been
suppressed
Only
now
by
means
of
smuggled
documents
obtained
at
great
personal
risk
to
all
involved
can
this
fabulous
story
come
to
light
the
story
of
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Ernie
was
intrigued
He
read
on
Our
story
must
really
begin
in
Ancient
Egypt
deep
in
the
mysteries
of
the
Middle
Kingdom
an
age
which
produced
some
of
the
greatest
wonders
the
world
has
even
seen
Some
of
these
like
the
Pyramids
have
been
known
to
the
world
for
millennia
Yet
it
stands
to
reason
that
any
people
capable
of
producing
wonders
like
these
wonders
which
the
modern
world
has
yet
to
equal
must
also
have
been
capable
of
producing
many
other
amazing
things
on
a
smaller
scale
Yet
all
of
these
have
been
lost
in
the
sands
of
time
or
have
they
Let
us
consider
for
a
moment
the
phonograph
a
relatively
simple
device
invented
in
the
last
century
by
Thomas
Edison
In
its
basic
form
it
consists
of
a
disc
or
even
a
cylinder
driven
by
a
crank
that
comes
in
contact
with
a
needle
attached
to
a
cone
One
can
then
either
play
or
record
simply
by
turning
the
crank
and
either
speaking
into
the
cone
or
listening
That
s
all
there
is
to
it
A
simple
device
like
this
can
be
made
with
almost
anyone
with
basic
tools
It
could
have
been
made
thousands
of
years
ago
it
could
even
have
been
made
by
the
ancient
Egyptians
Certainly
any
civilization
capable
of
producing
incredible
engineering
feats
like
the
Pyramids
would
be
capable
of
constructing
a
simple
mechanical
device
like
this
Now
there
is
evidence
that
they
did
In
the
tomb
of
the
Pharaoh
Pepto
II
at
Bismol
hieroglyphics
have
been
found
which
bear
an
uncanny
resemblance
to
Edison
s
early
phonographs
Along
with
these
were
others
which
were
translated
to
read
and
the
voice
of
the
Pharaoh
shall
speak
on
after
he
is
gone
and
fragment
missing
that
we
who
are
as
dogs
to
the
mighty
Pharaoh
shall
listen
to
Our
Master
s
Voice
Ernie
looked
at
the
accompanying
illustration
It
was
a
picture
from
an
Egyptian
tomb
showing
a
dog
listening
to
some
kind
of
a
device
with
a
cone
coming
out
of
it
It
reminded
Ernie
of
something
Didn
t
it
look
a
lot
like
the
RCA
Victor
logo
Then
again
maybe
not
He
continued
reading
But
this
is
only
the
beginning
It
would
be
monumental
enough
if
records
of
the
voices
of
the
Pharaohs
had
been
found
but
what
has
actually
been
discovered
is
so
spectacular
as
to
make
the
Pharaohs
seem
trivial
by
comparison
It
was
of
course
phonograph
records
that
the
Arab
shepherd
found
They
were
in
the
form
of
discs
made
of
fine
clay
a
material
much
more
durable
than
the
perishable
vinyl
that
our
present
day
phonograph
records
are
made
of
and
were
packed
in
the
crumbling
remains
of
an
Egyptian
style
case
When
played
at
approximately
rpm
they
produced
voices
much
like
our
own
early
phonograph
records
But
stop
and
consider
These
records
were
found
deep
in
Israel
near
the
Sea
of
Galilee
in
other
words
nowhere
near
the
Egypt
of
the
Pharaohs
There
is
no
evidence
that
the
phonograph
was
ever
used
in
ancient
Israel
what
s
more
they
were
in
an
Egyptian
style
case
and
bore
Egyptian
markings
How
could
they
have
come
to
a
cave
near
the
Sea
of
Galilee
There
is
only
one
way
They
must
have
been
brought
there
from
Egypt
by
the
fleeing
Israelites
Hieroglyphics
prove
that
the
phonograph
was
in
existence
at
this
time
what
would
have
been
more
reasonable
than
for
the
fleeing
Israelites
taking
with
them
the
treasures
of
Egypt
to
take
with
them
this
great
treasure
But
what
would
they
have
used
it
for
What
else
but
for
the
same
use
as
the
Pharaohs
to
record
and
preserve
the
voice
of
their
leader
so
that
his
will
can
be
known
forever
the
voice
of
Moses
Yet
if
this
device
the
phonograph
was
in
the
hands
of
Moses
wouldn
t
he
have
used
it
to
record
the
things
he
considered
of
greatest
importance
In
that
case
wouldn
t
he
have
taken
it
to
Mount
Sinai
Wouldn
t
he
have
used
it
to
record
the
voice
of
God
Himself
Now
you
can
see
why
this
find
has
been
suppressed
why
no
government
no
religious
institution
on
Earth
can
afford
to
let
these
records
be
heard
They
contain
at
the
very
least
the
voice
of
Moses
and
possibly
even
the
very
voice
of
God
There
may
be
things
on
these
records
which
could
change
the
life
of
every
man
woman
and
child
on
Earth
now
today
in
the
th
century
But
will
these
records
ever
be
heard
Or
will
they
be
hidden
away
in
a
secret
vault
kept
from
a
world
that
needs
them
so
desperately
They
must
be
heard
The
people
have
a
right
to
this
knowledge
knowledge
which
affects
each
and
every
one
of
them
in
every
facet
of
their
daily
lives
Right
now
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
where
they
are
being
held
or
by
whom
or
for
what
purpose
But
a
find
like
this
CANNOT
be
suppressed
It
is
to
earth
shaking
too
monumental
Word
WILL
leak
out
people
WILL
be
told
Already
this
has
begun
to
happen
secret
documents
have
been
smuggled
out
incontrovertible
evidence
has
been
uncovered
It
is
beginning
now
it
is
only
a
mater
of
time
before
the
world
learns
the
awesome
truth
about
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Ernie
put
the
magazine
down
Wow
he
thought
This
is
really
heavy
Is
this
for
real
or
is
this
just
more
crazy
nonsense
Did
this
really
happen
or
is
this
just
more
garbage
caused
by
sticking
together
too
many
computer
programs
that
don
t
belong
together
How
can
we
tell
the
difference
Ernie
thought
about
the
problem
This
is
an
important
question
he
decided
We
may
have
stumbled
onto
something
really
meaningful
Somebody
ought
to
look
into
this
Somebody
ought
to
find
out
whether
this
is
for
real
or
not
because
if
it
is
real
it
might
be
really
important
Ernie
stopped
He
hadn
t
the
vaguest
idea
how
somebody
would
go
about
looking
into
a
question
like
this
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
Here
look
at
this
article
He
handed
the
magazine
to
the
Captain
The
Captain
peered
at
the
article
The
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Get
real
Captain
Memory
tossed
the
magazine
over
his
shoulder
No
really
Ernie
protested
This
is
important
stuff
I
really
think
you
should
consider
it
What
if
this
really
happened
What
if
this
is
like
a
secret
CIA
computer
file
or
something
I
mean
stuff
like
that
could
be
here
right
It
s
possible
isn
t
it
Aything
s
possible
the
Captain
admitted
But
how
likely
is
it
Ernie
heard
snickering
coming
from
behind
him
He
turned
Sterno
had
picked
up
the
magazine
and
was
leafing
through
it
You
actually
READ
this
stuff
laughed
Sterno
Here
s
a
good
article
Princess
Diana
says
I
m
Carrying
Elvis
s
Baby
Or
how
about
I
Was
Raped
by
Killer
Lesbians
from
Outer
Space
Ernie
frowned
Something
about
that
last
headline
sounded
a
little
familiar
Sterno
continued
Here
another
one
Earth
invaded
by
Aliens
Disguised
as
s
TV
Characters
Hey
lemme
see
that
Ernie
reached
for
the
magazine
convinced
that
they
were
onto
something
What
trash
Sterno
dropped
the
magazine
in
the
wastebasket
Hey
Ernie
fished
through
the
wastebasket
trying
to
retrieve
the
magazine
Oh
no
it
s
all
covered
with
sticky
wine
The
pages
are
all
stuck
together
Wow
man
said
the
Fly
wonderingly
That
s
really
heavy
stuff
Imagine
that
Princess
Diana
pregnant
with
Elvis
s
baby
I
never
knew
that
Ernie
was
trying
to
separate
the
pages
of
the
magazine
but
the
Mad
Dog
wine
had
dissolved
most
of
the
ink
and
he
was
only
succeeding
in
making
a
big
mess
Did
you
really
think
you
were
going
to
find
the
secrets
of
the
universe
in
that
magazine
asked
Sterno
sarcastically
I
don
t
think
you
re
going
to
get
anywhere
with
that
stuff
added
Captain
Memory
I
think
you
re
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
I
suppose
you
think
that
s
funny
Sterno
snarled
He
regarded
Ernie
for
a
moment
You
know
that
little
hat
looks
really
ridiculous
Yeah
guy
the
Fly
chimed
in
How
come
you
re
wearing
that
Mickey
Mouse
hat
It
s
not
a
Mickey
Mouse
hat
alright
said
Ernie
frustrated
It
s
part
of
the
outfit
You
re
supposed
to
wear
this
kind
of
a
little
hat
I
dunno
why
you
re
just
supposed
to
Ernie
sulked
Leave
me
alone
Sterno
chuckled
The
only
good
thing
about
having
him
along
he
said
gesturing
at
Ernie
Is
that
he
can
always
cheer
me
up
If
I
didn
t
have
him
to
laugh
at
I
don
t
know
WHAT
I
d
do
Ernie
glowered
The
Fly
was
sitting
at
a
dressing
table
regarding
himself
in
the
mirror
He
kept
examining
various
bottle
of
cosmetics
holding
each
in
turn
up
to
his
face
but
he
couldn
t
find
any
that
matched
his
shell
tone
My
what
big
eyes
you
have
quipped
Sterno
How
about
some
eyeliner
Or
maybe
some
mascara
for
your
antenna
Aw
c
mon
guys
the
Fly
complained
Gimme
a
break
huh
I
was
just
looking
for
a
little
like
bronzer
y
know
Y
think
bronzer
would
look
good
on
me
His
antennae
waved
hopefully
Ernie
was
feeling
irritable
He
was
tired
of
everyone
picking
on
him
all
the
time
Why
do
you
keep
reading
that
TV
Guide
he
snapped
at
Captain
Memory
So
I
can
see
what
s
on
answered
the
Captain
reasonably
How
can
you
possibly
tell
what
s
on
when
you
don
t
even
know
where
we
are
You
re
never
gonna
have
the
right
listings
for
here
wherever
THIS
is
Sure
I
do
disagreed
the
Captain
I
ve
got
the
listings
for
everywhere
How
could
you
have
that
Ernie
was
skeptical
This
is
the
Inter
Continuum
Edition
with
Multi
Galactic
Sub
Listings
for
the
week
of
May
Infinity
explained
the
Captain
It
s
got
the
listings
for
all
of
Time
and
Space
Lemme
see
that
Ernie
snatched
it
rudely
out
of
Captain
Memory
s
hand
Why
the
pages
are
all
blank
Are
you
a
subscriber
the
Captain
wanted
to
know
gently
taking
the
book
back
out
of
Ernie
s
hands
Well
no
Ernie
admitted
Well
that
s
why
you
can
t
see
it
Ernie
sighed
He
guessed
that
made
as
much
sense
as
anything
else
CM
examined
the
listings
carefully
Wanna
watch
an
old
movie
Here
s
a
classic
Mr
Blandings
Builds
his
Dream
Horse
Ernie
frowned
You
mean
House
Captain
Memory
was
puzzled
Mr
House
Builds
his
Dream
Horse
Ernie
shook
his
head
No
no
It
s
supposed
to
be
Mr
Blandings
Builds
his
Dream
House
Captain
Memory
peered
at
the
TV
Guide
It
quite
clearly
says
here
Horse
That
s
ridiculous
Ernie
insisted
You
can
t
build
a
horse
That
s
right
the
Fly
chimed
in
At
least
not
without
a
permit
Huh
Ernie
was
taken
aback
And
an
inspection
the
Fly
went
on
I
mean
you
wouldn
t
want
to
ride
a
horse
that
was
built
without
a
permit
and
wasn
t
inspected
It
wouldn
t
be
safe
Uh
Something
about
this
didn
t
sound
right
to
Ernie
The
Fly
continued
with
enthusiasm
I
mean
like
what
if
you
took
this
horse
out
on
the
freeway
you
know
and
you
re
cruisin
along
doin
maybe
and
all
of
a
sudden
boom
A
leg
falls
off
Then
what
Somebody
could
get
hurt
Ernie
didn
t
know
how
to
argue
with
this
Uh
I
suppose
you
re
right
He
fell
silent
Captain
Memory
broke
the
silence
Hey
here
s
a
good
show
Follow
the
Yellow
Brick
Road
The
Fab
Four
stop
for
a
drink
at
The
Deer
Bar
and
meet
aliens
disguised
as
s
TV
characters
Starring
Lucille
Ball
Adam
West
and
Rin
Tin
Tin
How
about
that
Sounds
okay
to
me
said
the
Fly
agreeably
Ernie
looked
around
the
room
There
s
no
TV
he
said
triumphantly
Oh
there
s
always
a
TV
the
Captain
assured
him
Okay
where
Ernie
demanded
Hmm
Captain
Memory
looked
around
He
got
up
walked
over
to
the
dressing
table
and
peered
into
the
mirror
Let
s
try
this
Mirror
mirror
on
the
wall
Ain
t
there
no
TV
at
all
The
surface
of
the
mirror
dissolved
and
an
image
of
The
Deer
Bar
appeared
in
its
place
Four
characters
were
seated
at
the
bar
drinking
beer
So
what
are
we
gonna
do
now
guys
asked
the
Fly
sipping
a
beer
through
his
long
flexible
snout
Ernie
started
and
looked
about
confusedly
They
were
suddenly
all
back
at
The
Deer
Bar
His
stomach
flipped
over
again
What
uh
how
did
we
get
back
here
Same
way
we
got
out
said
Captain
Memory
gesturing
towards
the
TV
set
He
looked
momentarily
confused
Either
that
or
maybe
we
never
really
left
at
all
I
forget
which
Oh
well
it
doesn
t
really
matter
Ernie
looked
up
at
the
television
above
the
bar
which
now
was
turned
on
A
sadistic
Nazi
talk
show
host
was
using
a
diabolical
looking
device
to
torture
members
of
the
audience
Uh
do
you
mind
if
I
turn
that
off
asked
Ernie
If
you
like
answered
the
Captain
indifferently
Ernie
switched
off
the
set
and
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Now
they
were
safe
He
frowned
Well
maybe
they
weren
t
safe
but
they
were
safER
He
thought
about
it
a
moment
Well
maybe
they
weren
t
really
any
safer
but
turning
the
TV
off
made
him
feel
better
just
the
same
That
satisfied
him
so
he
returned
to
his
seat
The
Fly
looked
around
Like
we
re
the
only
ones
here
Uh
huh
Ernie
agreed
So
what
happened
to
like
Ricky
and
Lucy
As
if
in
answer
the
door
to
the
bar
flew
open
and
in
staggered
Ricky
his
ruffled
Cuban
shirt
in
rags
his
maracas
broken
Close
behind
him
was
Lucy
her
hair
disarrayed
her
party
dress
torn
and
smeared
with
dirt
You
feelthy
peeg
shrieked
Ricky
enraged
You
send
us
behind
door
numero
four
I
keel
you
What
did
he
say
the
Fly
asked
confusedly
I
can
t
understand
his
accent
at
all
I
think
he
said
he
was
going
to
keel
us
Sterno
volunteered
What
s
that
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
Something
to
do
with
boats
Ricky
advanced
on
the
foursome
holding
his
shattered
maracas
menacingly
Ernie
noticed
that
they
seemed
to
have
acquired
very
sharp
edges
I
keel
you
I
cut
your
brain
out
he
threatened
Ernie
Hey
he
s
starting
up
with
that
brain
stuff
again
Ernie
said
to
Captain
Memory
What
do
we
do
Have
a
beer
said
Captain
Memory
sipping
his
Deer
Beer
That
s
easy
for
you
to
say
It
s
not
your
brain
he
s
after
Ernie
looked
at
Ricky
apprehensively
Why
don
t
you
just
let
him
have
your
brain
snickered
Sterno
You
ll
never
miss
it
Ricky
slowly
staggered
forward
Ernie
noticed
that
Ricky
was
getting
much
more
sort
of
reptilian
looking
He
seemed
to
have
acquired
long
sharp
teeth
and
a
forked
tongue
which
flitted
in
and
out
of
his
mouth
in
a
snake
like
manner
Hey
uh
shouldn
t
we
uh
DO
something
Ernie
urged
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
looked
annoyed
Oh
all
right
He
cleared
his
throat
And
now
he
announced
pompously
A
word
from
our
sponsor
Ricky
froze
Oh
ees
a
commercial
he
said
to
Lucy
We
got
to
wait
Well
I
guess
we
d
better
get
going
fellas
Captain
Memory
said
to
the
other
three
We
ve
only
got
sixty
seconds
He
gulped
down
the
rest
of
his
beer
I
hate
to
drink
beer
in
a
hurry
It
upsets
my
stomach
He
burped
He
brushed
past
Ricky
and
Lucy
who
were
frozen
into
a
state
of
immobility
and
led
the
group
out
the
door
Once
outside
Captain
Memory
checked
his
bare
wrist
Hmm
ten
more
seconds
I
know
let
s
try
this
The
Captain
led
the
group
around
the
side
of
the
building
where
they
could
not
be
seen
from
the
main
door
Fifteen
seconds
later
Ricky
and
Lucy
burst
out
of
the
bar
door
Where
dey
go
Ricky
screamed
Dey
not
suppose
to
move
during
de
commercial
Dey
got
to
wait
for
de
show
to
start
again
Ricky
and
Lucy
looked
quickly
around
and
then
charged
off
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
bank
The
Fly
peeked
around
the
corner
Looks
like
they
re
gone
Ernie
frowned
Are
these
aliens
really
that
stupid
he
asked
the
Captain
I
m
afraid
so
Captain
Memory
replied
Ernie
frowned
Something
about
this
didn
t
seem
to
make
sense
If
they
re
so
stupid
how
come
they
ve
got
interstellar
travel
and
blasters
and
stuff
like
that
he
asked
pointedly
Well
you
know
aliens
have
brother
in
laws
too
Captain
Memory
explained
Brothers
in
law
Sterno
corrected
Uh
right
the
Captain
went
on
Uh
relatives
They
have
relatives
too
Everybody
has
relatives
So
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Captain
Memory
sighed
Well
what
do
you
do
if
your
brother
in
law
needs
a
job
but
he
s
not
too
um
bright
I
mean
you
can
t
leave
him
to
starve
right
After
all
he
s
married
to
your
sister
Okay
so
maybe
your
sister
doesn
t
have
real
good
taste
in
men
she
s
still
your
sister
right
And
what
about
your
nephews
Get
to
the
point
Sterno
demanded
impatiently
Okay
okay
Captain
Memory
went
on
Anyway
you
ve
got
to
get
him
a
job
but
you
don
t
want
to
get
him
anything
too
like
visible
because
you
know
