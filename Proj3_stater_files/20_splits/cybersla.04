I
m
intelligent
I
m
a
fun
guy
you
know
I
got
a
good
job
a
nice
car
I
paid
a
lotta
money
for
this
suit
He
fingered
the
expensive
silk
lapels
But
girls
nowadays
do
they
care
Naw
all
they
care
about
is
looks
The
Fly
continued
animatedly
He
really
seemed
to
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
get
all
of
this
off
his
chest
I
mean
I
go
into
a
bar
you
know
not
one
of
those
sleazy
places
but
a
nice
singles
spot
where
the
drinks
cost
like
five
bucks
each
you
know
I
figure
maybe
I
can
meet
some
nice
girls
here
So
I
see
some
cute
chick
I
try
to
start
up
a
conversation
and
like
does
she
even
give
me
a
chance
Hell
no
I
mean
she
doesn
t
even
wait
to
find
out
like
what
I
m
all
about
or
anything
It
s
just
gasp
scream
faint
gasp
scream
faint
the
same
old
thing
over
and
over
again
I
mean
what
kind
of
a
way
is
that
to
behave
Don
t
girls
have
any
manners
anymore
He
sighed
Looks
All
they
care
about
is
looks
Gee
that
s
too
bad
Ernie
really
didn
t
know
what
to
say
Thanks
guy
the
Fly
answered
I
really
appreciate
it
I
don
t
get
to
talk
to
too
many
people
around
here
you
know
A
disturbing
thought
occurred
to
Ernie
Is
this
guy
okay
he
whispered
to
Captain
Memory
I
mean
he
s
not
an
alien
or
anything
is
he
Oh
no
laughed
Captain
Memory
He
s
the
Fly
You
saw
the
movie
didn
t
you
Well
yeah
admitted
Ernie
But
I
thought
it
was
well
a
movie
You
see
replied
Captain
Memory
I
told
you
it
could
be
worse
At
least
you
re
trapped
in
Cyperspace
as
yourself
He
s
trapped
as
the
Fly
Ernie
had
to
admit
that
the
Captain
was
right
about
that
Still
it
didn
t
make
him
fell
much
better
Anyway
continued
Captain
Memory
looking
at
the
Fly
The
aliens
are
much
prettier
I
say
said
Sterno
to
the
Fly
You
wouldn
t
happen
to
have
a
cigar
on
you
by
any
chance
would
you
Sure
guy
the
Fly
pulled
out
an
expensive
gold
cigar
case
and
flipped
it
open
Sterno
removed
a
cigar
and
examined
it
Lovely
He
seemed
very
pleased
Havana
no
less
Thanks
ever
so
much
Hey
my
pleasure
The
Fly
seemed
to
enjoy
the
opportunity
to
show
off
his
fine
quality
things
It
seemed
to
Ernie
that
the
Fly
had
gone
to
a
lot
of
trouble
to
get
the
best
of
everything
but
didn
t
have
much
opportunity
to
impress
people
with
it
Are
we
going
to
be
leaving
here
soon
Sterno
inquired
of
Captain
Memory
It
is
awfully
damp
in
here
and
it
rather
bothers
my
sinuses
Ernie
shivered
The
dampness
was
getting
to
him
too
Wearing
only
a
loincloth
as
he
was
he
had
little
protection
from
the
chill
Hey
I
like
the
loincloth
guy
the
Fly
said
to
Ernie
That
s
the
new
in
thing
right
Maybe
I
ll
get
one
You
think
the
girls
would
go
for
it
Ernie
didn
t
know
how
to
reply
Well
I
guess
there
s
no
point
in
hanging
around
here
much
longer
Captain
Memory
decided
After
all
there
s
no
TV
You
guys
gonna
leave
The
Fly
seemed
crestfallen
or
perhaps
antenna
fallen
But
you
just
got
here
He
brightened
Hey
you
guys
are
gonna
go
someplace
fun
right
Can
I
come
Huh
Can
I
Well
Captain
Memory
began
Do
you
know
how
we
can
get
out
of
here
Sterno
inquired
Hey
no
problem
answered
the
Fly
You
can
take
the
out
of
LaGuardia
and
that
ll
get
you
there
in
about
oh
two
hours
forty
minutes
but
if
you
want
the
special
rate
you
gotta
stay
from
Sunday
through
Saturday
but
not
any
Mondays
or
you
can
take
the
out
of
O
Hare
but
then
you
gotta
What
about
the
door
Ernie
broke
in
Oh
The
Fly
was
disappointed
He
enjoyed
showing
off
his
detailed
knowledge
of
travel
arrangements
Yeah
well
there
s
always
the
door
Ernie
looked
at
the
door
It
was
made
of
heavy
steel
and
seemed
to
be
secure
bolted
So
how
do
we
open
it
Just
knock
The
Fly
seemed
to
think
this
was
all
too
simple
and
therefore
not
very
much
fun
Ernie
knocked
He
heard
the
sound
of
a
bolt
being
thrown
back
and
the
door
creaked
open
Outside
were
two
burly
guards
in
black
Nazi
SS
uniforms
Ja
Uh
is
it
okay
if
we
go
now
Ernie
asked
brightly
NEIN
The
door
slammed
Oh
not
like
that
The
Fly
seemed
impatient
You
gotta
use
like
subterfuge
you
know
Here
I
ll
show
you
The
Fly
was
pleased
to
have
another
opportunity
to
show
off
his
expertise
at
something
He
knocked
on
the
door
The
door
creaked
open
again
Ja
I
gotta
go
to
the
bathroom
the
Fly
said
urgently
The
guards
looked
at
each
other
Vhat
are
ve
supposed
to
do
now
Dey
didn
t
tell
us
vhat
to
do
if
dis
happened
They
looked
hesitant
Vell
I
don
t
know
I
don
t
tink
so
Sensing
failure
the
Fly
quickly
switched
tactics
Hey
look
he
cried
pointing
past
the
guards
A
naked
lady
Vhere
VHERE
cried
the
guards
peering
into
the
distance
The
Fly
threw
his
entire
weight
against
the
door
which
flew
open
RUN
he
cried
to
the
others
He
sprinted
toward
center
stage
followed
by
Ernie
Sterno
and
Captain
Memory
A
startled
von
Liederkranz
was
on
center
stage
trying
to
flirt
with
the
chorus
girls
Guards
he
cried
Don
t
let
dem
get
avay
He
grabbed
the
nearest
weapon
which
in
this
case
happened
to
be
an
alien
Blaster
of
unknown
properties
He
aimed
it
at
the
foursome
who
were
sprinting
towards
a
door
marked
EXIT
Shtop
or
I
ll
shoot
Von
Liederkranz
threatened
The
four
continued
to
run
Von
Liederkranz
pulled
the
trigger
A
huge
ball
of
magneto
gravitational
energy
flashed
from
the
muzzle
of
the
Blaster
instantly
hurtling
Ernie
and
the
others
into
a
totally
different
Space
Time
Continuum
Von
Liederkranz
looked
ruefully
at
the
Blaster
and
then
at
the
smoking
hole
in
the
stage
where
the
foursome
had
been
only
a
nanosecond
earlier
Vell
von
Liederkranz
admitted
Perhaps
dot
vasn
t
der
best
veapon
to
use
Chapter
Ernie
Captain
Memory
Sterno
and
the
Fly
sat
on
a
rocky
crag
overlooking
a
lifeless
purple
sea
They
watched
the
waves
crash
against
the
rocks
beneath
them
Ernie
sighed
So
where
are
we
now
Well
as
far
as
I
can
figure
out
said
Captain
Memory
thoughtfully
We
seem
to
have
been
blasted
back
to
somewhere
on
the
order
of
four
billion
B
C
Life
has
not
evolved
yet
on
Earth
Huh
said
Ernie
You
mean
we
traveled
in
time
Of
course
not
the
Captain
replied
What
really
happened
is
that
we
got
sent
to
another
sector
of
Cyberspace
Probably
by
accident
Captain
Memory
looked
around
After
all
I
can
t
see
any
reason
for
Von
Liederkranz
to
have
sent
us
here
on
purpose
Ernie
looked
out
over
the
purple
waves
So
where
ARE
we
I
mean
really
Captain
Memory
thought
a
moment
We
re
probably
in
somebody
s
Geology
program
You
know
like
computer
models
of
primeval
Earth
He
looked
at
the
barren
landscape
While
we
didn
t
actually
travel
in
time
it
s
almost
as
if
we
did
This
is
like
actually
being
on
Earth
at
the
beginning
of
life
Wow
thought
Ernie
That
s
really
cosmic
The
Fly
looked
at
the
bare
rocks
around
them
You
know
man
this
place
is
like
really
dead
Exactly
Captain
Memory
agreed
I
mean
the
Fly
went
on
There
is
like
no
girls
None
at
all
That
s
right
So
like
what
good
is
it
Captain
Memory
thought
a
moment
Good
question
Ernie
watched
the
orange
sun
in
a
green
sky
which
was
slowly
setting
against
a
purple
sea
This
is
really
a
weird
scene
he
commented
I
have
never
seen
anything
like
this
Not
even
on
TV
He
thought
about
that
for
a
moment
Not
even
on
TV
Why
that
could
mean
that
there
s
No
TV
Captain
Memory
agreed
Not
much
reason
to
stay
here
then
is
there
Ernie
noticed
a
motion
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
I
m
not
sure
you
ought
to
throw
those
cigar
butts
on
the
ground
here
he
said
to
Sterno
Sterno
looked
annoyed
Why
in
the
world
not
Well
I
don
t
know
that
much
about
this
Ernie
said
But
it
seems
to
me
I
read
somewhere
that
the
further
you
go
back
in
time
the
more
effect
your
actions
have
on
the
future
Therefore
if
we
make
even
little
changes
way
back
here
in
four
billion
B
C
it
might
have
some
kind
of
real
big
effect
by
the
time
we
get
back
to
our
own
time
Utterly
ridiculous
scoffed
Sterno
flicking
cigar
ash
into
the
sea
This
isn
t
REALLY
four
billion
B
C
it
s
only
a
computer
model
of
four
billion
B
C
Well
yeah
Ernie
admitted
uneasily
But
the
Captain
said
that
this
was
almost
the
same
as
really
being
there
And
I
dunno
I
just
have
a
real
bad
feeling
about
those
cigar
butts
Really
Sterno
looked
totally
bored
I
just
can
t
tell
you
how
concerned
that
makes
me
He
yawned
Well
well
I
just
don
t
think
it
s
a
good
idea
that
s
all
Well
you
know
how
it
goes
said
Captain
Memory
jovially
It
s
all
just
six
of
one
twelve
dozen
of
another
Ernie
frowned
I
don
t
think
that
s
right
Isn
t
it
Oh
well
said
Captain
Memory
cheerily
Math
was
never
one
of
my
strong
points
Anyway
no
time
to
worry
about
that
now
Let
s
be
off
shall
we
He
though
a
moment
Let
s
try
some
Machine
Language
F
E
The
scene
vanished
The
foursome
found
themselves
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
road
in
bright
sunlight
Once
again
Ernie
blinked
and
staggered
his
stomach
doing
flip
flops
As
his
vision
cleared
He
could
see
around
him
what
appeared
to
be
an
idyllic
country
scene
A
rustic
rail
fence
bordered
the
road
Beyond
the
fence
stood
farms
surrounded
by
fields
full
of
amber
waves
of
grain
In
the
distance
stood
majestic
purple
mountains
Ernie
turned
around
Behind
them
lay
a
broad
plain
Ernie
was
pretty
sure
there
was
fruit
on
it
I
wonder
where
we
are
the
Fly
asked
Sterno
looked
around
Kansas
he
suggested
Ernie
began
to
get
that
queasy
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
again
A
look
down
confirmed
his
worst
fears
the
road
was
yellow
brick
I
don
t
think
I
like
this
said
Ernie
warily
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
You
never
like
anything
Ernie
tried
to
explain
Well
you
see
I
know
I
know
Sterno
interrupted
You
have
a
really
bad
feeling
about
this
You
ve
seen
it
all
before
You
think
it
s
a
trap
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Well
yeah
Sterno
sighed
You
know
this
is
all
becoming
really
tiresome
I
do
SO
wish
you
d
find
something
else
to
go
on
about
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Suddenly
he
smiled
broadly
Hey
I
get
it
This
is
all
really
just
a
game
right
Sterno
moaned
Not
THAT
again
Even
Captain
Memory
looked
annoyed
The
Fly
was
confused
Like
what
is
this
guy
talking
about
he
asked
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
just
rolled
his
eyes
upward
and
made
little
spinning
motions
around
his
temple
with
his
forefinger
Oh
wow
the
Fly
went
on
So
is
this
guy
like
crazy
or
what
Well
you
know
how
it
is
Captain
Memory
explained
not
unsympathetically
Some
people
just
don
t
deal
well
with
travel
It
s
too
stressful
for
them
It
upsets
their
systems
Oh
wow
said
the
Fly
compassionately
Poor
guy
Ernie
was
annoyed
Awright
you
guys
knock
it
off
okay
I
mean
enough
is
enough
all
right
Actually
he
thought
there
was
probably
quite
a
bit
of
truth
to
what
Captain
Memory
had
been
saying
The
stress
probably
WAS
upsetting
his
system
However
even
if
he
agreed
with
what
the
Captain
had
to
say
he
resented
his
tone
of
voice
So
like
what
are
we
gonna
do
now
guys
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
Well
the
Captain
began
jovially
I
guess
we
ll
just
have
to
follow
the
DON
T
SAY
IT
Ernie
broke
in
Okay
Just
don
t
say
it
Touchy
touchy
sniffed
Sterno
Captain
Memory
was
somewhat
taken
aback
Well
have
it
your
way
Let
s
go
that
way
He
gestured
down
the
road
The
Fly
shook
his
head
I
shoulda
known
Anybody
who
d
wear
a
loincloth
like
that
He
noticed
Ernie
glaring
at
him
and
stopped
Hey
no
offense
He
shrugged
Ernie
scowled
They
began
walking
down
the
road
Ernie
peered
ahead
Far
ahead
down
the
road
he
seemed
to
see
something
large
and
green
Big
and
green
Ernie
thought
Is
that
the
Emerald
Suddenly
Ernie
had
an
idea
He
stopped
clicked
his
heels
together
three
times
clenched
his
eyes
tightly
shut
and
said
There
s
no
place
like
home
There
s
no
place
like
home
There
s
no
place
like
home
He
opened
his
eyes
The
other
three
were
standing
around
him
staring
What
is
WRONG
with
you
Sterno
demanded
Ernie
was
acutely
aware
of
everyone
watching
him
I
m
having
a
bad
day
okay
he
said
defensively
Just
leave
me
alone
He
began
walking
forward
again
quickly
My
aren
t
we
sensitive
today
Sterno
said
snidely
The
Fly
shook
his
head
sadly
The
human
mind
is
such
a
fragile
thing
They
proceeded
down
the
road
The
green
object
in
the
distance
began
to
resolve
itself
into
some
kind
of
building
Ernie
continued
to
be
very
unhappy
about
the
entire
situation
but
decided
he
was
sick
of
being
made
fun
of
and
said
nothing
They
approached
the
green
building
It
was
done
in
Greek
revival
style
with
huge
Classical
columns
in
the
front
Hey
it
s
a
bank
noticed
the
Fly
Do
you
suppose
I
can
cash
a
check
The
letters
carved
into
the
Greek
style
pediment
of
the
building
did
in
fact
identify
it
as
a
bank
Ernie
was
confused
He
hadn
t
expected
to
find
a
bank
here
Why
would
there
be
a
bank
here
Ernie
asked
incredulously
Captain
Memory
regarded
the
building
Looks
like
we
might
have
run
into
a
piece
of
somebody
s
business
program
Accounting
or
bank
operations
or
something
He
shook
his
head
That
s
what
happens
when
you
start
sticking
a
bunch
of
unrelated
systems
together
You
never
know
WHAT
you
re
going
to
wind
up
with
They
proceeded
up
the
long
marble
stairway
and
entered
the
bank
The
interior
was
huge
and
very
ornate
done
in
Victorian
style
Everything
seemed
antique
as
though
the
bank
were
right
out
of
the
th
century
They
walked
up
to
a
row
of
teller
s
windows
each
of
which
was
protected
by
elaborate
Victorian
grillwork
The
Fly
pulled
a
very
nice
quality
leather
checkbook
out
of
his
suit
pocket
Hey
he
said
to
the
teller
a
rather
prim
looking
young
woman
Can
you
cash
a
check
I
m
sorry
we
can
t
She
didn
t
really
seem
to
be
sorry
at
all
We
can
t
do
anything
right
now
Our
computers
are
down
Ernie
looked
around
He
saw
men
at
high
desks
carefully
copying
numbers
with
long
quill
pens
Nowhere
was
there
any
sign
of
electricity
much
less
computers
You
don
t
have
any
computers
Ernie
said
suspiciously
The
teller
s
expression
turned
ugly
Well
we
re
still
not
going
to
cash
your
check
she
snapped
Why
not
The
Fly
wanted
to
know
We
can
t
do
any
business
Our
our
accountant
has
gone
crazy
she
concluded
triumphantly
Ernie
looked
at
the
teller
suspiciously
Something
very
peculiar
was
going
on
here
However
he
decided
not
to
say
anything
about
it
because
he
didn
t
want
to
be
made
fun
of
I
wanna
talk
to
the
manager
the
Fly
decided
Good
the
teller
sneered
The
manager
would
like
to
talk
to
all
of
you
RIGHT
NOW
The
teller
came
out
from
behind
the
counter
and
led
them
all
into
a
room
which
looked
very
much
like
a
bank
office
There
behind
a
very
large
desk
sat
a
disagreeable
looking
old
woman
with
a
sour
expression
Ernie
somehow
knew
that
the
woman
had
something
unpleasant
in
mind
for
them
Well
it
s
about
time
she
snapped
as
they
entered
the
room
There
s
a
little
matter
of
an
unpaid
balance
to
be
taken
care
of
Ernie
looked
at
the
woman
She
was
wearing
a
severely
tailored
grey
suit
with
her
greying
hair
pulled
back
in
a
tight
bun
For
some
reason
however
she
was
wearing
shoes
that
didn
t
match
her
outfit
They
were
a
brilliant
sparkling
red
The
Fly
approached
the
desk
Hey
I
got
this
check
Just
one
minute
The
manager
cut
him
off
rudely
There
s
a
little
matter
to
be
taken
care
of
first
She
pulled
out
a
sheaf
of
papers
We
have
an
invoice
here
for
Time
Continuum
Repair
and
Reality
Maintenance
which
was
referred
to
our
department
for
non
payment
Which
of
you
is
going
to
take
care
of
this
matter
Sterno
was
becoming
impatient
What
ARE
you
talking
about
The
manager
began
reading
from
the
papers
It
seems
there
was
a
little
problem
with
cigars
butts
left
at
four
billion
B
C
Ernie
glared
at
Sterno
who
looked
innocently
off
into
the
air
twiddling
his
thumbs
It
seems
these
foreign
materials
left
at
such
an
early
point
caused
slime
creatures
to
evolve
into
the
dominant
life
form
on
Earth
Precluding
this
disgusting
development
required
a
maintenance
order
which
took
let
me
see
she
flipped
through
the
pages
and
pulled
out
a
sheet
marked
Work
Order
Here
it
is
one
million
two
hundred
and
fifty
two
thousand
and
three
standard
Earth
years
and
forty
five
minutes
Now
at
per
hour
plus
time
and
a
half
for
overtime
and
double
time
on
Sundays
that
comes
to
she
flipped
through
some
more
pages
One
hundred
and
ninety
five
quadrillion
four
hundred
and
twelve
trillion
seven
hundred
and
seventy
one
billion
two
hundred
and
thirteen
million
three
hundred
and
twelve
thousand
and
thirty
two
dollars
and
twenty
nine
cents
She
peered
at
Captain
Memory
Would
you
like
to
take
care
of
this
balance
at
this
time
Captain
Memory
shrugged
Don
t
look
at
me
I
don
t
have
any
money
The
manager
peered
at
the
Fly
who
looked
uncomfortable
Hey
sorry
but
I
got
obligations
you
know
I
got
car
payments
I
gotta
pay
the
rent
He
trailed
off
The
bank
manager
looked
at
Ernie
Ernie
laughed
This
was
all
just
too
ridiculous
Sure
put
it
on
my
charge
he
said
flippantly
The
bank
manager
smiled
maliciously
Mr
Ernest
Ross
she
said
in
an
disagreeable
tone
of
voice
carefully
writing
his
name
on
the
invoice
with
a
quill
pen
Captain
Memory
looked
at
Ernie
horrified
Oh
you
shouldn
t
have
said
that
he
said
in
an
ominous
tone
Ernie
began
to
get
the
feeling
that
maybe
he
had
made
a
big
mistake
The
bank
manager
looked
up
at
him
Now
when
may
we
expect
payment
Ernie
looked
desperately
to
the
others
They
were
all
pointedly
ignoring
him
Look
he
said
urgently
Forget
I
said
that
okay
I
take
it
back
Oh
I
m
sorry
she
said
in
a
tone
of
malicious
sweetness
I
m
afraid
you
can
t
do
that
Now
will
you
be
paying
in
cash
or
by
check
A
hundred
and
ninety
five
quadrillion
dollars
said
the
Fly
wonderingly
That
s
a
lot
of
money
That
s
more
than
I
make
in
a
week
Ernie
was
beginning
to
panic
No
I
won
t
Forget
it
I
m
not
going
to
pay
that
bill
You
ll
pay
this
bill
my
fine
little
friend
the
bank
manager
cackled
Or
I
ll
take
care
of
you
she
looked
at
Sterno
and
your
little
dog
too
She
laughed
nastily
What
a
witch
the
Fly
commented
Suddenly
Ernie
had
a
brilliant
idea
He
grabbed
a
vase
of
flowers
off
the
desk
yanked
the
flowers
out
of
it
and
threw
the
water
all
over
the
bank
manager
Eeyah
she
screamed
I
m
all
wet
The
Fly
looked
at
Ernie
wonderingly
Why
in
the
world
did
you
do
that
Ernie
looked
at
the
bank
manager
She
was
glaring
and
hissing
at
him
water
dripping
off
her
face
She
was
not
melting
at
all
Ernie
became
uncomfortably
aware
of
everyone
staring
at
him
Uh
well
I
thought
Ernie
stuttered
You
ll
have
to
excuse
our
friend
Captain
Memory
ad
libbed
quickly
It
s
the
stress
you
see
Financial
problems
He
s
not
coping
The
three
began
hustling
Ernie
towards
the
door
The
bank
manager
arose
hissing
and
spitting
You
haven
t
heard
the
last
of
this
she
shrieked
You
ll
see
The
four
rushed
quickly
through
the
bank
and
