He
decided
to
try
not
to
look
at
it
He
regarded
the
horse
instead
There
was
definitely
something
peculiar
about
that
horse
Ernie
decided
It
seemed
to
be
somewhat
lumpy
and
misshapen
There
seemed
to
be
a
line
going
around
its
middle
almost
like
a
seam
Why
would
a
horse
have
a
seam
the
new
Miss
Galaxy
The
shouts
and
applause
drew
Ernie
s
attention
back
to
the
television
where
the
winning
contestant
was
being
crowned
And
now
The
celebrity
judges
leaned
forward
expectantly
Their
broad
grins
revealed
rows
of
needle
sharp
teeth
Their
forked
tongues
flicked
in
and
out
of
their
mouths
in
anticipation
it
s
CARVING
TIME
The
announcer
whipped
out
a
whirring
chainsaw
and
advanced
on
the
hapless
Miss
Galaxy
who
struggled
feebly
while
the
two
runner
ups
held
her
in
place
Oh
man
the
Fly
complained
I
told
you
I
don
t
like
horror
movies
They
give
me
the
creeps
Let
s
watch
something
else
He
changed
the
channel
A
commercial
was
on
the
new
station
A
man
was
sitting
behind
a
desk
looking
deadpan
directly
at
the
camera
The
phone
on
the
desk
began
to
ring
Does
your
heart
sink
when
the
telephone
rings
the
man
said
Because
of
bill
collectors
constantly
threatening
you
about
unpaid
debts
Hmm
Ernie
thought
As
a
matter
of
fact
it
does
Why
not
call
Acme
Debt
Counseling
Service
the
commercial
continued
We
ve
helped
millions
avoid
the
nightmare
of
bad
debts
We
ll
set
up
a
payment
plan
you
can
afford
and
get
those
bill
collectors
off
your
back
once
and
for
all
Call
today
That
s
an
idea
Ernie
thought
I
don
t
know
if
it
ll
work
but
it
s
worth
a
try
Maybe
they
can
keep
Vito
away
long
enough
for
us
to
get
out
of
here
at
least
He
picked
up
the
phone
and
dialed
the
number
that
was
displayed
at
the
bottom
of
the
screen
Acme
Debt
Counseling
Service
a
woman
s
voice
answered
Yeah
I
just
Ernie
began
Ah
Mr
Ross
A
man
s
voice
cut
in
We
ve
been
expecting
you
I
have
your
file
right
here
in
front
of
me
Oh
Ernie
was
taken
aback
How
could
they
have
known
he
was
going
to
call
You
ll
be
pleased
to
know
that
we
ve
worked
out
a
very
convenient
payment
plan
to
take
care
of
this
matter
the
man
continued
The
collection
agency
has
agreed
to
accept
the
payment
plan
and
has
agreed
to
call
off
Vito
who
was
on
his
way
to
well
we
d
rather
not
say
what
Vito
was
going
to
do
But
anyway
you
don
t
need
to
worry
about
that
now
Everything
is
all
taken
care
of
Ernie
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
This
collection
agency
business
was
really
beginning
to
bother
him
They
seemed
to
be
able
to
find
him
no
matter
where
in
time
or
space
he
was
He
was
really
glad
that
he
wasn
t
going
to
have
to
worry
about
it
any
more
We
ve
broken
this
down
into
small
easy
to
afford
weekly
payments
the
man
on
the
phone
continued
Now
if
you
ll
just
send
in
the
first
week
s
payment
in
cash
of
course
the
man
laughed
You
can
t
expect
us
to
accept
a
check
from
someone
with
YOUR
credit
history
we
ll
get
the
ball
rolling
on
this
Um
how
much
is
the
payment
Ernie
asked
hesitantly
Only
a
week
the
main
exclaimed
glowingly
Hey
don
t
thank
us
it
s
our
job
Uh
um
ahem
Ernie
cleared
his
throat
nervously
The
man
on
the
phone
stopped
There
was
an
awkward
silence
You
re
NOT
going
to
tell
us
you
don
t
have
are
you
Uh
well
Ernie
began
Um
I
don
t
exactly
have
that
much
on
me
right
now
that
is
If
you
could
give
me
a
little
time
a
couple
of
years
maybe
The
man
on
the
phone
sighed
Oh
that
IS
unfortunate
Well
there
may
still
be
something
we
can
do
I
ll
have
to
talk
to
my
supervisor
about
this
Please
hold
The
man
s
voice
disappeared
and
tinny
Muzak
came
over
the
receiver
in
it
s
place
Ernie
sighed
Well
he
hadn
t
really
thought
that
was
going
to
work
anyway
Still
maybe
they
could
come
up
with
something
yet
He
waited
listening
to
low
fidelity
versions
of
s
pop
hits
played
by
the
Million
and
One
Strings
Ernie
sighed
again
He
hated
being
left
on
hold
After
what
seemed
a
very
long
time
the
man
s
voice
reappeared
Good
news
he
exclaimed
cheerfully
My
supervisor
said
we
may
still
be
able
to
work
something
out
Ernie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Great
The
man
continued
My
supervisor
says
that
if
you
don
t
have
the
cash
right
now
we
might
be
able
to
accept
something
else
of
value
instead
Like
what
Ernie
couldn
t
imagine
what
he
might
have
with
him
that
would
be
worth
Oh
I
don
t
know
Just
some
little
thing
the
man
said
evasively
Like
maybe
your
brain
MY
BRAIN
Ernie
shrieked
Now
now
don
t
get
excited
the
man
said
soothingly
After
all
what
s
one
little
brain
among
friends
You
ll
never
miss
it
FORGET
IT
Ernie
slammed
down
the
phone
Mr
Ed
shook
his
head
sadly
I
think
you
should
have
taken
that
deal
he
advised
Forget
it
I
m
not
going
to
give
them
my
brain
He
glared
at
the
horse
What
business
is
it
of
yours
anyway
Hey
The
Fly
interceded
Don
t
pick
on
Mr
Ed
He
stroked
the
horse
Nice
horsey
Why
not
give
them
your
brain
Sterno
suggested
You
never
use
it
Ernie
glared
Leave
me
alone
Ernie
looked
at
the
TV
Black
and
white
images
of
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
were
on
the
screen
Lucy
seemed
to
be
upset
about
something
What
are
we
watching
anyway
More
I
Love
Lucy
reruns
Captain
Memory
looked
at
the
TV
Guide
That
s
funny
This
is
supposed
to
be
a
movie
called
Nazi
Cheerleaders
from
Planet
X
Ernie
looked
at
the
TV
Oh
yeah
Who
s
in
it
Captain
Memory
consulted
the
TV
Guide
Let
me
see
uh
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
Ernie
frowned
I
dunno
It
looks
an
awful
lot
like
I
Love
Lucy
to
me
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Doesn
t
it
strike
you
as
just
a
little
bit
odd
that
absolutely
EVERYTHING
on
TV
right
now
has
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
in
it
No
I
don
t
think
that
s
odd
at
all
said
Mr
Ed
in
his
typical
low
voiced
drawl
Why
shouldn
t
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
be
in
everything
They
re
probably
the
two
greatest
performers
who
ever
lived
Huh
Ernie
didn
t
know
how
to
answer
that
In
fact
Mr
Ed
went
on
rapturously
I
d
say
that
they
are
definitely
the
finest
performers
that
show
business
has
ever
produced
the
greatest
that
ever
COULD
be
produced
in
fact
in
all
of
time
and
space
no
one
anywhere
in
the
universe
could
possibly
even
approach
the
greatness
of
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
Oh
come
off
it
snapped
Sterno
irritatedly
They
re
just
a
couple
of
second
rate
TV
actors
Ay
carramba
Mr
Ed
cried
furiously
What
chu
talkin
about
Dey
de
greatest
Especialmente
Desi
Arnaz
de
greatest
Cuban
bandleader
in
de
world
Ernie
looked
at
Mr
Ed
suspiciously
Hey
what
happened
to
your
voice
Where
did
you
get
that
Cuban
accent
Mr
Ed
was
flustered
Hey
man
I
uh
oh
Something
very
peculiar
seemed
to
be
happening
to
Mr
Ed
He
seemed
to
be
writhing
in
a
very
un
horselike
manner
Suddenly
Mr
Ed
fell
in
half
Both
halves
lay
on
the
floor
each
writhing
independently
Ernie
was
stunned
He
stared
at
the
two
halves
of
Mr
Ed
jaws
open
with
astonishment
Suddenly
a
head
covered
with
rolled
red
curls
popped
out
of
the
back
half
of
Mr
Ed
Oh
uh
hi
guys
It
was
Lucy
Lucy
turned
to
the
front
half
of
Mr
Ed
which
was
still
writhing
on
the
floor
Oh
Ricky
I
told
you
to
let
me
be
the
front
half
of
the
horse
Now
look
what
s
happened
A
voice
came
from
the
front
half
of
Mr
Ed
Lucy
I
stuck
in
dis
horse
suit
Help
me
out
okay
The
front
half
of
Mr
Ed
thrashed
wildly
filling
the
room
with
the
sound
of
thuds
and
maracas
Lucy
struggled
out
of
her
half
of
the
horse
suit
and
ran
over
to
help
Ricky
However
the
more
she
tried
to
help
him
the
more
tangled
up
he
got
The
Fly
looked
ruefully
at
the
horse
suit
Poor
Mr
Ed
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Now
what
The
Captain
was
still
reading
his
TV
Guide
How
about
She
Devils
of
Green
Gables
with
Shirley
Temple
and
He
was
interrupted
by
a
loud
pounding
on
the
door
Open
up
They
all
looked
up
startled
The
pounding
came
again
Open
da
door
punk
I
know
you
re
in
dere
Lucy
turned
to
Ricky
who
was
still
stuck
in
the
horse
suit
Oh
Ricky
It
s
Vito
Let
him
in
will
you
Maybe
he
can
get
our
brain
from
that
awful
Ernie
person
She
glared
at
Ernie
Ricky
struggled
in
the
horse
outfit
You
got
to
get
me
out
of
here
He
cried
distressed
I
can
t
see
nuttin
in
dis
suit
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
I
think
we
ought
to
get
out
of
here
okay
The
Captain
continued
to
peruse
his
TV
Guide
Oh
you
ll
like
this
one
A
Funny
Thing
Happened
on
the
Way
to
Attila
the
Hun
with
Zero
Mostel
and
Ernie
paced
anxiously
Look
we
ve
got
to
do
something
All
these
people
are
after
my
brain
Sterno
shrugged
Call
the
police
Ernie
started
The
police
That
was
worth
a
try
He
grabbed
the
phone
and
dialed
Ernie
fidgeted
impatiently
while
the
phone
rang
He
heard
the
sound
of
the
phone
being
taken
off
the
hook
You
gotta
help
me
he
began
He
stopped
The
voice
on
the
other
end
was
a
recording
We
re
sorry
all
of
our
officers
are
busy
at
the
moment
If
you
re
being
murdered
please
leave
a
clue
and
one
of
our
detectives
will
contact
your
next
of
kin
as
soon
as
possible
Thank
you
and
have
a
nice
day
Ernie
slammed
the
phone
down
disgustedly
Vito
pounded
on
the
door
again
Open
up
Ernie
looked
apprehensively
at
Ricky
who
was
still
struggling
to
get
out
of
the
horse
suit
Look
I
really
think
we
ought
to
get
out
of
here
Like
NOW
Captain
Memory
looked
up
in
annoyance
Well
if
you
re
going
to
be
that
way
about
it
He
got
up
and
strode
across
the
living
room
and
through
an
open
doorway
which
seemed
to
lead
into
the
kitchen
Hey
wait
for
me
cried
Ernie
chasing
after
him
As
he
ran
he
grabbed
the
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
He
wasn
t
about
to
leave
a
fortune
in
precious
Bakelite
behind
He
continued
to
follow
the
Captain
He
didn
t
know
where
Captain
Memory
was
going
but
he
figured
it
would
have
to
be
an
improvement
The
Captain
walked
through
the
next
room
which
was
the
typical
suburban
kitchen
opened
a
typical
suburban
back
door
and
stepped
outside
Ernie
and
the
others
followed
quickly
behind
him
They
found
themselves
once
again
standing
in
a
countryside
of
green
rolling
hills
The
village
in
the
distance
seemed
to
have
burned
itself
out
and
only
feeble
wisps
of
smoke
were
rising
from
it
I
m
awfully
glad
we
got
out
of
there
commented
Sterno
It
was
really
getting
dreadfully
noisy
My
ears
are
very
sensitive
you
know
The
Fly
was
the
last
of
the
group
to
leave
the
villa
He
shook
his
head
sadly
Poor
Mr
Ed
It
must
have
been
a
real
shock
to
him
falling
in
half
like
that
Ernie
considered
trying
to
explain
the
situation
to
him
but
decided
it
wasn
t
worth
the
trouble
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Now
what
Captain
Memory
looked
around
Nice
day
isn
t
it
Ernie
tapped
his
feet
impatiently
I
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
we
went
someplace
else
They
re
going
to
be
coming
after
us
any
minute
now
Not
after
US
Sterno
corrected
After
YOU
Ernie
frowned
Yeah
They
want
my
brain
They
don
t
want
your
brain
Sterno
thought
about
this
and
decided
he
was
offended
Well
That
just
shows
what
those
silly
aliens
know
If
they
knew
anything
about
brains
at
all
they
d
realize
mine
is
clearly
superior
An
idea
occurred
to
Ernie
Yeah
you
re
right
Maybe
I
should
tell
them
Sterno
frowned
You
know
I
think
we
should
go
someplace
else
It
s
suddenly
become
awfully
boring
around
here
Nice
day
for
a
walk
don
t
you
think
said
Captain
Memory
strolling
off
towards
the
yellow
brick
road
The
others
followed
quickly
CHAPTER
After
a
few
minutes
walking
the
four
travelers
through
Cyberspace
began
to
see
an
encampment
of
some
kind
in
the
distance
What
do
you
suppose
that
is
Ernie
wondered
I
dunno
commented
Captain
Memory
Want
to
turn
around
and
go
the
other
way
Ernie
thought
of
Lucy
Ricky
and
Vito
all
of
whom
were
somewhere
behind
them
No
let
s
just
keep
going
It
doesn
t
really
matter
which
way
we
go
commented
Sterno
After
all
all
roads
lead
to
Rome
Ernie
thought
about
that
It
seems
to
me
that
would
cause
a
lot
of
traffic
problems
he
said
reflectively
The
Fly
peered
into
the
distance
Somebody
s
coming
Ernie
started
Uh
oh
what
do
we
do
now
He
thought
a
moment
Are
they
Romans
or
Huns
How
should
I
know
The
Fly
answered
Well
what
are
they
wearing
Funny
outfits
The
Fly
shrugged
What
are
they
supposed
to
be
wearing
Ernie
sighed
I
dunno
I
sort
of
hoped
they
d
be
wearing
togas
or
something
The
men
approaching
were
coming
into
Ernie
s
range
of
vision
They
seemed
to
be
a
military
patrol
They
wore
armor
some
kind
of
leggings
and
carried
shields
bows
and
spears
So
what
are
they
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
Romans
or
Huns
I
dunno
Ernie
said
Might
as
well
flip
a
coin
I
guess
You
got
a
coin
I
left
all
my
money
in
my
other
pants
pocket
Ernie
admitted
So
just
pick
one
then
the
Fly
urged
Well
Romans
then
If
they
re
Romans
we
could
talk
to
them
in
Latin
I
don
t
know
what
we
could
do
if
they
re
Huns
What
language
do
they
speak
Hungarian
I
don
t
speak
Hungarian
Do
you
speak
Latin
asked
Sterno
sarcastically
Well
well
I
used
to
watch
a
lot
of
gladiator
movies
said
Ernie
hopefully
Good
enough
said
the
Fly
encouragingly
You
go
talk
to
them
then
Why
ME
It
was
your
idea
the
Fly
returned
It
was
NOT
my
idea
I
never
We
ll
just
go
hide
in
these
bushes
in
the
meantime
The
Fly
sprinted
off
towards
a
little
group
of
bushes
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
followed
by
Sterno
and
Captain
Memory
Ernie
saw
that
the
soldiers
had
noticed
him
They
were
pointing
in
his
direction
and
saying
something
that
Ernie
could
not
make
out
Ernie
decided
his
only
course
of
action
was
to
brazen
it
out
He
bit
his
lip
uncertainly
and
walked
forward
in
what
he
hoped
would
seem
like
a
confident
manner
He
tried
to
think
of
something
to
say
in
Latin
Uh
E
Pluribus
Unum
he
called
out
Gallia
est
divisio
in
partes
tres
They
soldiers
looked
at
him
Hey
get
a
load
a
this
the
first
soldier
said
It
s
a
Roman
in
a
funny
outfit
He
turned
to
the
soldier
next
to
him
Hey
Frank
gimme
an
arrow
will
ya
I
wanna
shoot
this
guy
Ernie
realized
that
he
had
made
a
serious
tactical
error
He
decided
that
the
correct
move
at
this
point
would
be
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
Turning
abruptly
he
sprinted
towards
the
other
side
of
the
hill
half
expecting
to
feel
an
arrow
in
his
back
at
any
moment
As
he
ran
he
could
hear
little
bits
of
the
soldier
s
conversation
drifting
in
his
direction
whaddya
mean
you
don
t
got
any
arrows
I
told
you
to
save
some
arrows
How
come
nobody
never
does
what
I
tell
em
Ernie
ran
for
the
bunch
of
bushes
the
others
were
hiding
in
What
happened
the
Fly
asked
eagerly
We
guessed
wrong
answered
Ernie
glumly
Well
we
better
do
something
said
the
Fly
Cause
they
re
coming
this
way
I
don
t
think
they
can
find
us
in
here
said
Ernie
hopefully
Oh
yes
they
can
returned
Sterno
There
s
a
trail
of
sequins
leading
right
to
us
Ernie
s
heart
sank
He
knew
he
d
never
hear
the
end
of
this
Oh
man
said
the
Fly
You
better
ditch
that
suit
It
s
getting
us
in
a
lot
of
trouble
Luckily
Ernie
still
had
his
fur
loincloth
sandals
and
plastic
broadsword
He
had
been
afraid
to
discard
them
since
after
all
he
had
put
a
forty
dollar
deposit
on
them
He
quickly
changed
into
the
Goombah
the
Barbarian
costume
and
hid
the
toreador
outfit
under
a
rock
No
sooner
had
he
finished
changing
then
they
heard
a
voice
coming
from
behind
them
Hey
what
are
you
guys
doing
in
those
bushes
The
same
group
of
soldiers
Ernie
had
encountered
on
the
road
was
there
behind
them
Ernie
thought
fast
Uh
we
re
looking
for
blueberries
You
guys
see
any
blueberries
around
here
No
answered
the
first
soldier
And
anyway
it
ain
t
blueberry
season
so
why
don
t
you
guys
come
out
of
there
real
slow
The
soldiers
held
their
spears
in
a
menacing
fashion
Sure
whatever
you
say
Ernie
laughed
nervously
The
soldiers
inspected
the
foursome
suspiciously
The
first
soldier
looked
at
Ernie
So
what
are
you
supposed
to
be
Uh
I
m
Goombah
the
Barbarian
Ernie
announced
The
first
soldier
guffawed
Hey
Frank
get
a
load
a
this
This
guy
thinks
he
s
a
barbarian
The
other
soldiers
laughed
uproariously
Ernie
sulked
He
didn
t
see
what
was
so
funny
about
it
What
did
he
say
his
name
was
asked
Frank
Gumby
Gumby
the
Barbarian
The
soldiers
all
laughed
hysterically
Lookit
this
he
s
got
a
plastic
broadsword
A
real
tough
guy
He
doubled
over
with
laughter
The
first
soldier
gradually
composed
himself
Say
he
said
wiping
tears
of
laughter
from
his
eyes
You
didn
t
see
a
Roman
in
a
funny
suit
go
by
here
did
you
He
left
a
trail
of
sequins
that
led
right
in
here
Ernie
thought
fast
again
Uh
as
a
matter
of
fact
yeah
He
went
thataway
Ernie
pointed
down
the
road
The
soldiers
looked
in
that
direction
Aw
we
might
as
well
forget
it
We
ll
never
get
him
now
The
second
soldier
looked
at
Ernie
So
what
are
we
gonna
do
with
Gumby
here
At
the
mention
of
the
name
Gumby
the
soldiers
all
started
laughing
hysterically
again
Gumby
the
Barbarian
huh
the
first
soldier
commented
after
he
had
stopped
laughing
to
the
point
that
he
could
speak
again
Well
I
m
Joe
the
Hun
he
said
introducing
himself
This
here
s
Frank
the
Hun
and
back
there
that
s
Pete
the
Hun
He
looked
at
the
foursome
What
a
weird
bunch
I
guess
we
d
better
take
all
you
guys
to
the
boss
Who
s
the
boss
asked
Ernie
Attila
the
Hun
answered
Joe
That
figures
Ernie
thought
Ernie
decided
that
maybe
he
would
go
along
and
meet
Attila
the
Hun
especially
since
he
couldn
t
see
any
alternative
at
the
moment
The
foursome
headed
off
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
burning
village
escorted
by
the
Hun
soldiers
After
a
few
minutes
walk
they
entered
the
encampment
of
the
Huns
The
soldiers
led
them
to
a
large
tent
where
they
were
ushered
into
the
presence
of
an
imposing
figure
A
large
heavily
muscled
man
in
armor
sat
or
a
golden
throne
leaning
on
a
huge
broadsword
Attila
King
of
the
Huns
a
soldier
announced
Attila
regarded
the
foursome
carefully
Why
have
you
brought
these
creatures
before
me
he
demanded
in
a
thunderous
voice
Uh
well
sir
said
Joe
the
Hun
timidly
We
didn
t
know
what
else
to
do
with
them
He
started
to
giggle
This
one
he
pointed
at
Ernie
He
says
his
name
s
Gumby
the
Barbarian
He
put
his
hand
over
his
mouth
to
stifle
his
laughter
Attila
regarded
Ernie
seriously
Is
that
correct
he
demanded
sternly
Uh
actually
it
s
Goombah
Ernie
said
timorously
Attila
erupted
in
thunderous
laughter
That
s
great
Gumby
the
Barbarian
That
s
hysterical
He
turned
to
the
soldiers
You
guys
dressed
him
up
like
this
for
a
joke
right
No
it
s
for
real
Joe
protested
We
just
found
em
like
this
Attila
doubled
over
with
laughter
Wiping
the
tears
from
his
eyes
he
turned
to
the
Fly
Hey
lookit
this
guy
s
mask
It
s
