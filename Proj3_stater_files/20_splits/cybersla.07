he
s
going
to
screw
it
up
and
you
ll
get
blamed
So
you
get
him
a
job
that
pays
good
but
is
um
out
of
the
way
Like
for
instance
interstellar
scout
Sure
he
ll
screw
it
up
but
he
s
millions
of
light
years
away
who
s
gonna
know
Ernie
looked
crestfallen
I
always
thought
they
d
send
you
know
their
Top
Guns
their
best
and
brightest
to
attack
us
You
re
mean
they
send
their
screw
ups
to
invade
our
planet
Captain
Memory
shrugged
Well
you
know
it
s
a
bureaucracy
This
is
the
real
universe
Life
s
like
that
Ernie
sighed
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
Anyway
I
think
it
s
time
to
get
going
He
headed
off
purposefully
down
the
yellow
brick
road
going
in
the
opposite
direction
from
that
in
which
Ricky
and
Lucy
had
gone
The
group
trailed
along
behind
him
CHAPTER
Ernie
caught
up
to
Captain
Memory
as
the
foursome
headed
down
the
yellow
brick
road
So
where
are
we
anyway
he
wanted
to
know
The
Captain
looked
around
Could
be
Kansas
I
suppose
he
said
thoughtfully
You
don
t
KNOW
Captain
Memory
shrugged
You
can
t
expect
me
to
keep
track
of
all
these
PLACES
he
said
annoyedly
Do
you
know
how
many
PLACES
there
are
in
Cyberspace
There
s
there
s
He
hesitated
confusedly
Well
I
don
t
know
exactly
how
many
but
there
s
a
whole
lot
of
them
And
they
keep
changing
all
the
time
too
I
mean
you
can
go
someplace
you
know
real
well
you
come
back
in
a
few
nanoseconds
and
it
s
all
different
It
was
bad
enough
before
Waldo
Stadium
starting
networking
all
these
systems
that
were
never
meant
to
be
networked
Now
it
s
impossible
So
don
t
expect
ME
to
keep
track
of
it
It
isn
t
MY
fault
He
calmed
down
Anyway
he
said
more
composedly
I
guess
it
could
be
Nebraska
Ernie
peered
into
the
distance
What
s
all
that
smoke
He
pointed
to
a
large
cloud
on
the
horizon
The
Fly
looked
searchingly
into
the
distance
With
his
huge
multi
faceted
insect
eyes
he
could
see
more
clearly
than
any
human
That
s
not
smoke
that
s
dust
he
explained
There
s
a
whole
lot
of
trucks
and
cars
and
stuff
heading
this
way
There
s
enough
to
be
an
army
of
em
He
peered
into
the
distance
In
fact
it
IS
an
army
They
got
tanks
and
guns
and
everything
Ernie
felt
uneasy
So
whose
army
it
is
They
Fly
squinted
I
can
t
tell
too
much
dust
Maybe
we
should
just
get
out
of
the
way
and
let
them
go
by
Sterno
suggested
This
seemed
like
an
excellent
idea
to
Ernie
They
stepped
off
the
road
climbed
over
a
picturesque
split
rail
fence
and
made
their
way
into
a
cornfield
where
they
hid
themselves
among
the
tall
plants
Ernie
noticed
a
scarecrow
out
in
the
middle
of
the
field
He
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
but
then
he
decided
to
just
leave
it
alone
In
a
few
minutes
the
first
vehicles
of
the
military
column
began
to
pass
them
Ernie
noticed
that
they
were
armored
personnel
carriers
painted
tan
and
grey
On
the
side
of
each
was
the
insignia
of
a
palm
tree
with
a
swastika
at
the
base
Ernie
recognized
it
from
watching
war
movies
on
the
late
show
It
s
the
Afrika
Korps
he
whispered
to
Captain
Memory
What
would
they
be
doing
in
Kansas
or
maybe
Nebraska
Aha
said
Captain
Memory
quietly
So
that
s
it
Rommel
must
be
advancing
on
Omaha
Therefore
it
will
be
up
to
Prince
Eugene
to
stop
the
Turkish
hordes
at
the
gates
of
Vienna
In
that
case
Colonel
Jackson
must
be
heading
down
the
mighty
Mississippi
at
this
very
moment
taking
a
little
bacon
and
a
little
beans
to
fight
the
bloody
British
at
the
town
of
New
Orleans
That
means
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
wrist
It
must
be
Oh
Ernie
no
longer
expected
Captain
Memory
s
explanations
to
shed
much
light
on
things
although
thinking
about
it
something
about
the
last
part
of
Captain
Memory
s
explanation
did
sound
a
little
familiar
But
then
on
the
other
hand
everything
sounded
a
little
familiar
but
none
of
it
actually
made
any
sense
Ernie
decided
to
try
again
even
though
he
didn
t
have
much
hope
of
success
So
what
s
going
on
anyway
Isn
t
this
supposed
to
be
like
the
Wizard
of
Oz
or
something
I
don
t
remember
any
Nazi
armies
in
the
Wizard
of
Oz
The
Wizard
of
Oz
the
Captain
asked
wonderingly
Whatever
gave
you
that
idea
Well
gee
Ernie
had
thought
it
was
obvious
There
s
this
yellow
brick
road
and
the
bank
manager
was
kind
of
a
witch
and
she
had
ruby
slippers
and
He
trailed
off
So
what
the
Captain
demanded
Well
If
this
isn
t
the
Wizard
of
Oz
where
did
all
that
stuff
come
from
The
Captain
was
annoyed
Sure
some
of
this
is
from
THE
WIZARD
OF
OZ
But
some
of
it
isn
t
Some
of
it
s
from
other
games
or
computer
models
or
databases
or
whatever
happened
to
be
in
the
systems
that
Waldo
s
been
taking
over
And
there
s
no
way
to
tell
what
ll
pop
out
where
or
when
Even
Waldo
can
t
keep
track
of
it
It
s
taking
all
his
computing
power
just
to
keep
the
system
halfway
organized
so
it
doesn
t
crash
You
know
how
hard
it
is
to
keep
a
FATAL
ERROR
from
creeping
into
this
stuff
It
s
only
because
he
s
got
a
multiple
redundant
neural
net
system
that
he
can
keep
this
stuff
running
at
all
Ernie
moaned
He
didn
t
like
the
sound
of
that
FATAL
ERROR
business
One
thing
bothers
me
though
the
Captain
continued
watching
the
military
vehicles
go
by
These
Nazis
They
re
showing
up
way
too
often
They
may
be
somehow
picking
up
our
trail
You
mean
Waldo
Stadium
knows
where
we
are
Ernie
cried
anxiously
He
s
zeroing
in
on
us
Could
be
said
the
Captain
thoughtfully
It
doesn
t
seem
like
they
know
exactly
where
we
are
but
it
does
seem
like
they
know
we
re
around
here
somewhere
I
wonder
how
they
know
that
Ernie
sighed
again
He
would
have
to
remember
not
to
ask
for
explanations
anymore
They
just
made
things
worse
After
a
few
minutes
the
last
of
the
military
vehicles
passed
taking
with
it
the
last
of
the
huge
cloud
of
dust
Ernie
coughed
He
and
the
others
were
all
covered
with
a
thick
layer
of
dirt
He
looked
at
himself
All
the
sparkle
was
gone
from
his
toreador
suit
Sterno
shook
himself
vigorously
sending
dust
flying
in
all
directions
Hey
watch
it
the
Fly
complained
That
stuff
gets
in
my
eyes
you
know
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
How
come
you
re
not
covered
with
dirt
he
demanded
Oh
it
s
the
suit
Captain
Memory
explained
fingering
his
comic
book
character
outfit
It
s
got
that
dirt
repelling
stuff
you
know
the
kind
you
put
in
the
dryer
Ernie
examined
his
toreador
outfit
On
the
inside
he
found
a
small
tag
Just
my
luck
Ernie
thought
Dry
Clean
Only
They
made
their
way
back
on
to
the
road
and
continued
in
the
same
direction
they
had
been
heading
before
the
convoy
went
by
A
light
breeze
sprang
up
and
carried
away
the
worst
of
the
dust
After
walking
for
a
few
minutes
Ernie
noticed
a
house
in
the
distance
As
they
approached
Ernie
could
see
that
it
was
an
elaborate
Victorian
cottage
covered
with
gingerbread
style
ornamentation
Hey
let
s
stop
in
the
Fly
suggested
Maybe
we
can
get
a
drink
of
water
All
this
dust
is
really
buggin
me
Oh
it
s
bugging
you
asked
Sterno
maliciously
Yeah
the
Fly
answered
ingenuously
Sterno
shrugged
There
was
no
point
in
sniping
at
people
who
were
too
dense
to
understand
it
As
they
neared
the
cottage
Ernie
noticed
that
it
was
surrounded
by
a
white
picket
fence
However
a
large
section
of
the
fence
had
been
knocked
over
The
lawn
seemed
to
be
all
chewed
up
as
though
by
the
treads
of
a
tank
Heading
up
the
front
walk
Ernie
noticed
the
door
was
broken
off
it
s
hinges
As
they
climbed
the
porch
Ernie
noticed
that
the
gingerbread
on
the
cottage
was
actual
gingerbread
the
edible
kind
Ernie
broke
off
a
piece
and
sniffed
it
It
seemed
fresh
He
took
a
bite
Very
tasty
he
thought
He
suddenly
realized
that
he
hadn
t
had
anything
to
eat
for
a
really
long
time
The
shutters
looked
interesting
they
had
frosting
and
raisins
Oh
wow
what
happened
here
Ernie
heard
the
Fly
ask
He
looked
through
the
door
Inside
were
obvious
signs
of
a
struggle
The
quaint
German
style
furniture
was
scattered
about
The
walls
were
pockmarked
with
bullet
holes
On
one
side
of
the
room
was
a
large
cast
iron
stove
Next
to
the
stove
stood
a
large
cage
with
its
door
open
The
stove
was
red
hot
and
a
bad
smell
came
from
it
Captain
Memory
considered
the
scene
and
regarded
the
tank
tracks
and
bullet
holes
Looks
like
whoever
was
here
got
arrested
by
the
Nazis
he
commented
Ernie
thought
about
this
Hansel
and
Gretel
arrested
by
the
Nazis
But
then
again
Hansel
and
Gretel
is
a
German
story
isn
t
it
In
that
case
Ernie
decided
it
s
none
of
my
business
I
won
t
worry
about
it
Instead
he
decided
to
look
for
something
else
to
eat
Ernie
found
an
old
fashioned
icebox
which
seemed
to
be
full
of
pies
cakes
and
other
goodies
There
didn
t
seem
to
be
anything
by
way
of
regular
wholesome
food
though
Oh
well
thought
Ernie
cutting
into
a
Bavarian
Black
Forest
Torte
I
guess
I
ll
just
have
to
rough
it
Sterno
was
helping
himself
to
an
eclair
Very
nice
he
commented
Would
you
mind
handing
me
a
piece
of
that
double
chocolate
rum
cheesecake
Hey
this
is
good
stuff
the
Fly
added
vacuuming
up
a
dish
of
frosted
ginger
snaps
through
his
long
snout
Ernie
stopped
Hey
how
do
we
know
this
stuff
is
okay
I
mean
maybe
this
is
an
alien
trap
or
something
Maybe
this
stuff
is
poisoned
Sterno
sniffed
disgustedly
We
can
always
count
on
you
to
say
something
utterly
inappropriate
at
the
table
can
t
we
Comments
like
that
can
ruin
everyone
s
appetite
The
first
decent
thing
we
ve
had
to
eat
on
this
entire
ridiculous
escapade
and
you
have
to
go
and
spoil
it
Ernie
was
upset
Well
okay
maybe
you
re
right
That
s
not
dinner
table
conversation
But
still
how
do
we
know
Sterno
sighed
The
problem
with
you
is
that
you
have
no
sense
of
smell
I
for
one
would
have
known
if
there
was
anything
wrong
with
these
delectable
little
morsels
Ernie
relaxed
So
this
place
isn
t
an
alien
trap
or
anything
he
asked
Captain
Memory
Oh
no
it
s
a
trap
alright
the
Captain
said
unconcernedly
helping
himself
to
a
dish
of
something
with
custard
and
cherries
in
it
WHAT
But
the
food
s
okay
the
Captain
continued
So
we
might
as
well
have
some
don
t
you
think
He
helped
himself
to
a
coconut
cream
pie
Ernie
suddenly
felt
very
anxious
So
uh
where
s
the
trap
then
Oh
I
don
t
know
the
Captain
went
on
We
ll
find
it
though
We
always
do
He
looked
at
Ernie
s
plate
Say
are
you
gonna
eat
that
Black
Forest
Torte
If
you
don
t
want
it
I
ll
take
it
Ernie
seemed
to
have
lost
his
appetite
Uh
here
Take
it
He
handed
the
dish
to
Captain
Memory
Ernie
s
stomach
was
beginning
to
feel
queasy
again
Stress
he
thought
It
s
not
good
for
me
I
m
gonna
get
an
ulcer
I
just
know
it
Ernie
noticed
an
open
door
in
the
back
of
the
cottage
It
seemed
to
lead
to
a
bathroom
Maybe
I
can
get
cleaned
up
Ernie
thought
The
dust
was
beginning
to
make
him
itch
Inside
the
door
Ernie
found
a
nicely
appointed
modern
bathroom
complete
with
soap
and
fresh
towels
I
ll
bet
I
have
time
for
a
quick
shower
he
thought
He
turned
on
the
shower
and
let
the
water
run
for
a
bit
Nice
and
warm
he
thought
Not
too
hot
Seems
okay
He
took
off
his
toreador
suit
shaking
the
dust
off
each
piece
in
turn
and
got
in
the
shower
Ernie
let
the
warn
water
run
over
him
Well
this
is
much
better
he
thought
relaxing
There
was
a
bottle
of
shampoo
on
the
tub
shelf
He
picked
it
up
and
examined
it
Placental
Protein
Shampoo
Oh
That
was
the
same
kind
of
shampoo
he
used
at
home
Maybe
it
would
get
the
dust
out
of
his
hair
Watch
ouph
phrm
trmp
What
Was
somebody
talking
to
him
Ernie
couldn
t
hear
over
the
sound
of
the
shower
He
stuck
his
head
out
Did
you
say
something
he
called
towards
the
others
Yes
answered
Captain
Memory
I
said
Watch
out
for
the
trap
WHAT
Ernie
leaped
out
of
the
shower
He
was
about
to
run
into
the
next
room
when
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
stark
naked
and
dripping
wet
He
decided
to
take
a
moment
to
grab
a
towel
and
wrap
it
around
himself
he
wasn
t
prepared
to
face
the
ridicule
he
would
have
gotten
otherwise
What
trap
Where
s
the
trap
You
re
holding
it
Captain
Memory
gestured
at
Ernie
The
TOWEL
Ernie
almost
flung
it
away
but
decided
against
it
No
your
other
hand
Ernie
looked
at
his
left
hand
He
was
still
unconsciously
clutching
the
bottle
of
shampoo
This
This
bottle
of
shampoo
Ernie
examined
it
What
is
it
a
bomb
or
something
No
it
s
a
bottle
of
shampoo
Captain
Memory
agreed
So
what
s
the
big
deal
Ernie
felt
a
little
foolish
getting
all
upset
over
a
bottle
of
shampoo
What
kind
of
shampoo
is
it
Captain
Memory
prompted
Placental
Protein
Shampoo
What
s
wrong
with
that
Do
you
know
what
a
placenta
is
Yeah
It
s
the
thing
that
feeds
an
embryo
in
the
womb
Ernie
had
gotten
an
A
in
biology
and
was
proud
of
it
Ever
wonder
what
proteins
from
embryos
are
doing
in
your
shampoo
Uh
now
that
you
mention
it
that
does
seem
a
little
strange
Ernie
admitted
Ever
wonder
proteins
from
embryos
of
WHAT
the
Captain
prodded
Or
what
KIND
of
proteins
I
don
t
like
the
sound
of
this
Ernie
said
quietly
Captain
Memory
went
on
DNA
is
a
protein
you
know
Ernie
thought
a
moment
You
mean
DNA
like
in
genetic
material
like
basic
building
blocks
of
life
the
stuff
that
determines
what
every
kind
of
life
form
is
going
to
be
That
s
right
the
Captain
agreed
Now
what
do
you
suppose
would
happen
to
you
if
you
rubbed
alien
DNA
from
unborn
space
creatures
onto
your
scalp
where
it
could
seep
right
down
into
your
brain
Ernie
looked
at
the
bottle
of
shampoo
uneasily
You
mean
it
could
like
take
over
your
brain
Could
be
Captain
Memory
agreed
However
it
doesn
t
work
all
at
once
It
has
to
seep
in
little
by
little
The
more
you
wash
your
hair
the
worse
it
gets
Ernie
was
suddenly
glad
he
didn
t
wash
his
hair
too
often
He
thought
for
a
moment
So
people
who
wash
their
hair
a
lot
would
get
it
the
worst
right
You
got
it
Captain
Memory
assented
cheerfully
Ernie
considered
the
problem
So
who
washes
their
hair
the
most
Pretty
girls
the
Fly
chimed
in
They
wash
their
hair
every
day
sometimes
more
than
once
I
know
cause
every
time
I
ask
one
out
one
she
says
I
can
t
go
today
I
gotta
wash
my
hair
That
s
true
Ernie
admitted
He
thought
a
moment
Wait
a
minute
We
have
this
stuff
at
home
In
fact
my
girlfriend
uses
it
The
Captain
considered
this
Noticed
any
changes
in
her
recently
Well
she
has
been
kind
of
cold
Ernie
conceded
And
now
that
you
mention
it
I
have
noticed
her
skin
getting
kind
of
scaly
but
I
thought
it
was
just
the
heartbreak
of
psoriasis
I
tried
to
say
something
about
it
but
she
hissed
at
me
Mmm
hmm
Captain
Memory
agreed
Y
know
I
noticed
that
a
lot
too
the
Fly
added
I
m
real
observant
and
I
noticed
that
an
awful
lot
of
pretty
girls
nowadays
have
forked
tongues
Ernie
frowned
He
had
noticed
something
odd
about
his
girlfriend
s
tongue
but
he
hadn
t
wanted
to
mention
it
He
didn
t
want
to
get
hissed
at
again
They
also
have
real
sharp
teeth
the
Fly
continued
And
slit
pupils
in
their
eyes
I
don
t
think
that
s
normal
do
you
All
of
this
was
making
Ernie
very
unhappy
You
mean
aliens
are
trying
to
take
over
the
Earth
he
asked
I
wouldn
t
doubt
it
Captain
Memory
answered
cheerfully
Well
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
cried
Ernie
Oh
you
don
t
need
to
worry
about
it
said
the
Captain
reassuringly
Why
not
asked
Ernie
suspiciously
It
s
just
a
game
anyway
right
The
Captain
gave
Ernie
a
cheery
smile
and
helped
himself
to
a
piece
of
lemon
meringue
pie
There
is
one
thing
you
could
do
Sterno
added
What
asked
Ernie
desperately
You
could
put
some
clothes
on
Sterno
said
looking
ruefully
at
the
peach
frappe
on
his
plate
The
sight
of
all
that
naked
skin
is
rather
spoiling
my
appetite
Oh
all
right
Ernie
snapped
stomping
off
to
the
bathroom
Sterno
sighed
Some
people
are
so
sensitive
he
commented
reaching
for
a
large
Cherries
Jubilee
Ernie
was
somewhat
placated
to
find
that
the
luster
had
returned
to
his
toreador
suit
The
only
thing
worse
than
having
to
go
around
in
a
toreador
outfit
was
having
to
go
around
in
a
DIRTY
toreador
outfit
He
returned
to
the
main
room
The
Fly
was
eating
what
seemed
to
be
large
cookies
of
some
kind
Hey
these
are
good
gingerbread
men
he
remarked
offering
one
to
Ernie
Ernie
examined
the
cookie
It
s
not
a
man
he
said
thoughtfully
It
looks
like
a
gingerbread
reptile
The
Fly
looked
at
the
cookies
Yeah
you
re
right
He
vacuumed
another
one
up
through
his
snout
They
re
good
though
Ernie
looked
at
the
cookie
ruefully
I
don
t
know
if
I
want
to
eat
a
reptile
Might
as
well
Captain
Memory
volunteered
It
wouldn
t
hesitate
to
eat
you
Ernie
put
the
cookie
down
quickly
He
seemed
to
have
lost
his
appetite
again
Ernie
heard
footsteps
approaching
the
house
A
man
in
a
post
office
uniform
carrying
a
bag
of
mail
was
coming
up
the
walk
Howdy
the
mailman
said
cheerfully
Nice
day
isn
t
it
Uh
yeah
Ernie
thought
he
should
be
the
one
to
answer
since
everyone
else
had
their
mouths
full
The
mailman
chatted
on
cheerily
Had
a
few
Nazis
a
mite
earlier
but
it
looks
like
it
cleared
up
He
looked
through
his
mail
Is
there
a
Mr
Ernest
Ross
here
Uh
that
s
me
Ernie
answered
unenthusiastically
Here
you
go
The
mailman
handed
Ernie
a
letter
Have
a
nice
day
He
left
Ernie
opened
the
letter
and
read
Dear
Mr
Ross

Ernie
looked
between
the
pages
There
was
no
enclosed
envelope
He
read
on
Sincerely

National
Bank
of
the
West
P
S
If
you

experiencing
financial
difficulties
at
the
moment
please

As
little
as
a
trillion
dollars
a
month

satisfactorily
take
care
of
this
account
Thank
you
Ernie
sighed
Isn
t
there
anywhere
you
can
go
to
get
away
from
junk
mail
I
doubt
it
answered
Captain
Memory
cutting
himself
a
big
slice
of
pineapple
upside
down
cake
Ernie
sighed
and
sat
down
on
the
nearest
piece
of
furniture
which
happened
to
be
a
child
s
rocking
chair
which
was
a
bit
too
small
for
him
Ernie
noticed
while
squeezing
himself
into
