really
weird
That
s
not
a
mask
the
Fly
was
offended
That
s
my
face
Attila
erupted
into
hysterical
laughter
again
He
says
it
s
his
face
That
cracks
me
up
The
laughter
was
contagious
all
the
soldiers
were
doubled
up
with
laughter
too
Hey
Gumby
Attila
chortled
What
are
you
gonna
do
with
that
plastic
broadsword
You
gonna
loot
pillage
and
rape
Well
uh
Ernie
stammered
I
m
uh
not
exactly
sure
how
to
do
that
Besides
uh
don
t
you
need
a
license
for
that
or
something
Attila
broke
up
again
License
to
loot
I
love
it
These
guys
are
hysterical
Sterno
was
getting
annoyed
This
IS
getting
a
bit
tedious
he
complained
Attila
s
jaw
dropped
Wow
A
talking
dog
What
a
great
act
I
get
it
now
you
guys
are
traveling
clowns
right
You
re
part
of
a
circus
right
Captain
Memory
looked
perturbed
He
seemed
to
be
sensitive
about
being
called
a
clown
Is
that
an
insult
Attila
collapsed
in
laughter
again
Is
that
an
insult
he
says
and
he
says
it
with
a
straight
face
You
guys
really
crack
me
up
The
foursome
shifted
about
uncomfortably
while
Attila
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
laughing
uncontrollably
After
what
seemed
to
be
a
very
long
time
Attila
looked
up
tears
of
laughter
still
streaming
down
his
face
Say
you
guys
are
just
great
We
ve
been
doing
so
much
raping
looting
and
pillaging
that
it
s
just
not
that
much
fun
anymore
What
I
really
need
these
days
is
a
good
laugh
I
feel
a
lot
better
now
He
thought
a
moment
I
think
I
ll
give
you
guys
a
reward
He
turned
to
Ernie
How
about
a
bag
of
gold
Would
you
like
that
Ernie
considered
that
Yeah
I
guess
that
would
be
nice
I
owe
kind
of
a
lot
of
money
right
now
and
I
ve
been
having
a
lot
of
problem
with
bill
collectors
Attila
chuckled
Yeah
I
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
bill
collectors
too
But
I
solved
that
problem
Wanna
know
how
Yeah
Ernie
was
excited
Maybe
he
could
use
this
solution
for
his
bill
paying
problems
Attila
chuckled
I
chopped
their
heads
off
You
should
have
seen
their
faces
He
thought
a
moment
In
fact
I
think
I
still
have
them
around
here
somewhere
Wanna
see
em
Ernie
grimaced
No
that
s
okay
I
m
not
supposed
to
look
at
severed
heads
It
makes
my
stomach
hurt
At
this
Attila
collapsed
into
helpless
laughter
again
You
guys
are
just
a
laugh
a
minute
Just
when
I
think
I
ve
heard
it
all
you
come
up
with
another
one
Ernie
frowned
None
of
this
seemed
very
funny
to
him
at
all
You
Huns
really
have
a
strange
sense
of
humor
Attila
s
brow
furled
We
do
huh
he
said
menacingly
Sterno
and
the
Fly
turned
to
look
at
Ernie
Ernie
shuffled
uncomfortably
It
occurred
to
him
that
maybe
he
shouldn
t
have
said
that
A
broad
grin
appeared
across
Attila
s
face
That
s
funny
I
like
it
Ernie
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
Suddenly
a
messenger
ran
up
to
the
King
of
the
Huns
Your
magnificence
we
found
these
strangers
lurking
around
the
edge
of
the
camp
Ernie
looked
behind
him
Hun
soldiers
were
dragging
forth
three
struggling
captives
The
first
was
someone
Ernie
did
not
recognize
a
beefy
man
in
an
ill
fitting
suit
The
other
two
were
Lucy
and
Desi
Oh
Vito
Lucy
said
to
the
beefy
man
Make
them
let
us
go
Oh
my
gosh
said
Ernie
involuntarily
Attila
looked
at
Ernie
sternly
Do
you
know
these
people
Uh
sort
of
Ernie
admitted
They
re
uh
bill
collectors
Attila
s
face
lit
up
Bill
collectors
My
favorite
Oh
what
fun
Let
s
see
he
paused
reflectively
Shall
we
boil
them
in
oil
or
flay
them
alive
Maybe
we
could
boil
them
until
they
re
tender
and
then
flay
them
Or
maybe
He
strode
off
to
examine
his
new
captives
leaving
Ernie
and
the
other
alone
Looks
like
you
ve
solved
the
bill
collector
problem
Sterno
said
to
Ernie
Uh
yeah
I
guess
so
decided
Ernie
So
why
don
t
we
get
out
of
here
before
Attila
decides
to
do
something
like
that
to
us
too
Oh
he
wouldn
t
do
that
the
Fly
said
Attila
likes
us
Ernie
watched
as
Attila
fingered
Lucy
s
red
curls
Lucy
bit
him
Attila
drew
his
sword
Ernie
decided
he
didn
t
want
to
watch
what
came
next
Just
the
same
let
s
go
okay
What
s
the
matter
said
Sterno
tauntingly
Don
t
you
want
to
see
what
Attila
s
going
to
do
to
them
Uh
I
d
just
as
soon
not
all
right
Let
s
just
go
okay
Sterno
continued
to
look
back
Looks
like
Lucy
s
losing
her
head
over
Attila
he
said
smirking
Ernie
s
stomach
turned
over
again
He
hadn
t
really
felt
very
good
ever
since
eating
that
remote
control
unit
he
was
sure
he
didn
t
want
to
see
anything
that
might
make
him
feel
worse
Attila
strode
back
to
his
throne
his
huge
broadsword
dripping
bright
red
blood
Gee
that
was
fun
He
sighed
Well
I
guess
I
gotta
get
back
to
business
Who
am
I
supposed
to
see
next
Three
representatives
of
the
King
of
the
Parthians
your
majesty
an
attendant
told
him
Oh
yeah
What
are
their
names
Larry
Moe
and
Curly
the
attendant
answered
Attila
thought
a
moment
Are
they
funny
I
believe
so
sire
Well
then
let
s
see
em
With
that
the
foursome
found
themselves
ushered
out
of
the
tent
The
four
of
them
stood
outside
Attila
s
tent
Well
now
what
The
Fly
wanted
to
know
That
s
a
good
question
Captain
Memory
began
Yes
sir
that
Okay
okay
Ernie
cut
him
off
He
didn
t
want
to
hear
that
whole
thing
all
over
again
Let
s
just
get
out
of
here
okay
Everybody
keeps
pointing
at
us
and
laughing
Sure
enough
as
they
looked
around
they
noticed
the
passing
Huns
all
pointing
the
foursome
out
to
each
other
and
making
what
Ernie
was
sure
were
snide
comments
Ernie
in
particular
was
getting
very
sensitive
about
snide
comments
made
at
his
expense
Let
s
go
guys
okay
he
urged
They
began
walking
down
the
yellow
brick
road
heading
out
of
the
Hun
s
camp
Soon
they
were
out
of
the
camp
and
heading
once
again
across
the
green
hills
The
road
rolled
on
before
them
over
hill
and
dale
heading
towards
Rome
maybe
The
road
seemed
to
stretch
on
endlessly
in
front
of
them
Ernie
sighed
It
looked
like
it
was
going
to
be
a
long
walk
After
what
seemed
to
be
a
very
long
time
they
noticed
something
up
ahead
of
them
It
seemed
to
be
a
huge
cloud
of
dust
heading
across
the
countryside
Whatever
it
was
it
was
going
to
cross
the
road
a
short
distance
in
front
of
them
Ernie
strained
his
eyes
Can
you
make
out
what
that
is
he
said
to
the
Fly
Oh
wow
said
the
Fly
It
s
a
cattle
drive
Don
t
be
ridiculous
snapped
Sterno
Cattle
can
t
drive
No
no
the
Fly
protested
It
s
cows
A
whole
bunch
of
cows
Herd
of
cows
Ernie
corrected
Of
course
I
ve
heard
of
cows
snapped
Sterno
Don
t
be
insulting
Well
they
re
coming
this
way
the
Fly
said
As
the
four
walked
along
they
began
to
make
out
more
clearly
a
vast
number
of
cattle
raising
a
huge
cloud
of
dust
with
their
hooves
What
are
all
these
cattle
doing
here
Ernie
wondered
As
if
in
answer
to
that
question
a
lone
figure
on
a
horse
came
galloping
toward
them
Hey
it
s
a
cowboy
the
Fly
said
cheerfully
Hiya
cowboy
He
waved
The
cowboy
galloped
up
to
them
and
stopped
Howdy
Any
of
you
boys
know
the
way
to
Abilene
Ernie
looked
around
Uh
sorry
I
m
a
stranger
here
myself
The
cowboy
scratched
his
head
This
country
don
t
look
at
all
familiar
We
ain
t
seen
a
thing
we
recognize
fer
quite
a
spell
now
Y
all
know
where
this
here
road
leads
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Uh
I
think
it
leads
to
Rome
but
I
m
not
sure
The
cowboy
considered
that
Rome
Is
that
in
Kansas
I
don
t
think
so
Ernie
said
The
cowboy
stroked
his
horse
s
muzzle
Well
Toto
he
said
to
his
horse
I
don
t
think
we
re
in
Kansas
anymore
He
turned
back
to
Ernie
Well
thank
ya
ll
kindly
he
said
tipping
his
hat
He
galloped
back
to
rejoin
the
herd
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
What
do
you
make
of
that
Tsk
tsk
the
Captain
shook
his
head
The
file
corruption
is
getting
really
severe
More
and
more
data
is
turning
up
in
the
wrong
sector
I
really
don
t
know
if
the
system
is
going
to
be
able
to
stand
much
more
of
this
Ernie
found
this
comment
disturbing
Why
What
ll
happen
then
The
Captain
shook
his
head
sadly
Well
well
it
might
He
trailed
off
Ernie
hated
it
when
people
trailed
off
It
always
made
him
terribly
uneasy
It
might
what
he
prompted
Captain
Memory
looked
uncomfortable
Are
you
sure
you
want
to
know
Ernie
thought
about
this
for
a
moment
and
decided
the
Captain
was
right
he
didn
t
want
to
know
The
Fly
however
had
become
interested
in
the
subject
Oh
I
get
it
we
re
supposed
to
guess
right
he
said
brightly
First
syllable
Sounds
like
He
began
gesticulating
in
a
peculiar
way
as
though
trying
to
act
out
some
unknown
word
This
is
fun
Sterno
grimaced
Will
you
please
stop
making
those
disgusting
motions
I
can
t
even
begin
to
tell
you
how
utterly
offensive
they
look
The
Fly
paid
no
attention
I
know
I
know
it
s
a
movie
star
right
He
began
prancing
about
in
a
very
disconcerting
manner
Is
it
a
dancer
huh
A
dancer
Well
no
Captain
Memory
looked
very
uncomfortable
I
know
I
know
The
Fly
jumped
up
and
down
excitedly
It
s
Fred
Astaire
right
Fred
Astaire
Uh
no
Captain
Memory
shifted
about
awkwardly
Gene
Kelly
The
Fly
shouted
excitedly
It
s
Gene
Kelly
right
Uh
uh
The
Captain
looked
at
the
ground
For
heaven
sake
s
tell
him
already
snapped
Sterno
Nothing
else
is
going
to
shut
him
up
Ernie
winced
He
really
didn
t
want
to
hear
this
If
it
was
bad
enough
for
Captain
Memory
to
warn
him
about
it
must
be
really
terrible
Especially
considering
all
the
terrible
things
the
Captain
had
told
him
WITHOUT
warning
him
He
shuddered
No
he
definitely
didn
t
want
to
hear
this
Captain
Memory
looked
very
unhappy
It
s
uh
I
know
I
know
The
Fly
was
totally
involved
with
the
game
Carmen
Miranda
It
s
Carmen
Miranda
right
Captain
Memory
sighed
It
s
well
it
s
TOTAL
SYSTEM
FAILURE
The
Fly
was
totally
taken
aback
Huh
Sister
Failure
Who
s
she
He
sulked
It
s
not
fair
to
use
people
who
aren
t
famous
How
am
I
supposed
to
guess
that
What
movies
has
she
been
in
anyway
Ernie
sighed
with
relief
System
Failure
Well
that
wasn
t
that
bad
He
frowned
It
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
feel
differently
if
he
had
any
idea
what
a
system
failure
was
What
he
started
to
say
then
stopped
On
second
thought
perhaps
he
d
rather
not
know
What
in
the
world
is
a
total
system
failure
supposed
to
be
Sterno
demanded
irritatedly
Captain
Memory
sighed
That
s
when
you
totally
exceed
the
operating
parameters
of
the
system
to
the
point
where
not
even
the
multiple
redundant
neural
net
backups
can
compensate
for
it
any
more
Huh
Ernie
wasn
t
following
that
Well
Captain
Memory
simplified
It
s
sort
of
like
the
system
has
a
heart
attack
Ernie
thought
about
that
And
if
the
system
has
a
heart
attack
Then
WE
have
a
heart
attack
Sterno
finished
for
him
Ernie
moaned
quietly
He
d
had
a
feeling
it
was
going
to
be
something
like
this
Why
did
they
have
to
tell
him
this
anyway
What
was
he
Ernie
supposed
to
do
about
it
What
did
they
have
to
tell
him
if
there
wasn
t
anything
he
could
do
about
it
His
stomach
hurt
He
decided
to
try
to
think
about
something
else
Their
path
was
now
blocked
by
the
herd
forcing
the
foursome
to
cool
their
heels
and
wait
for
the
animals
to
pass
They
waited
while
thousands
of
cattle
went
by
raising
a
huge
cloud
of
choking
dust
Finally
the
herd
passed
and
the
four
continued
on
their
way
They
walked
for
what
once
again
seemed
a
very
long
time
finding
nothing
Finally
the
Fly
noticed
something
Seems
to
be
something
going
on
up
ahead
he
commented
Looks
like
a
chariot
pulled
over
by
the
side
of
the
road
As
the
foursome
approached
they
could
see
that
it
indeed
was
a
chariot
Four
Romans
in
togas
stood
around
it
A
tire
on
one
of
the
wheels
seemed
to
have
gone
flat
and
they
were
pumping
it
up
with
a
hand
pump
Ernie
frowned
Are
chariots
supposed
to
have
tires
The
Fly
looked
at
the
chariot
Hey
it
s
got
old
fashioned
skinny
tires
on
spoked
wheels
like
a
Model
T
Ford
What
do
you
expect
I
dunno
Ernie
was
trying
hard
to
remember
what
the
chariots
looked
like
in
the
gladiator
movies
however
he
hadn
t
been
paying
attention
that
closely
With
all
the
stuff
that
s
been
happening
you
can
t
be
too
careful
Don
t
be
such
a
worry
wart
snapped
Sterno
Suppose
it
IS
a
phony
chariot
what
difference
does
it
make
Uh
Ernie
hadn
t
thought
that
far
ahead
His
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
one
of
the
Romans
who
approached
them
He
was
a
tall
thin
man
wearing
a
toga
He
seemed
like
a
typical
Roman
out
of
a
gladiator
movie
except
for
the
fact
that
he
wore
a
monocle
and
jackboots
The
man
s
arm
swept
out
in
a
Roman
salute
Heil
I
mean
Hail
he
said
cheerfully
Ernie
frowned
Weren
t
Romans
supposed
to
wear
sandals
The
man
continued
Ve
chust
finished
fixing
our
chariot
Perhaps
you
vould
like
a
ride
ja
You
bet
said
the
Fly
enthusiastically
Boy
I
m
really
sick
of
walking
Well
I
dunno
said
Ernie
Something
about
this
just
didn
t
seem
right
to
him
He
looked
at
the
two
white
horses
that
the
chariot
was
hitched
to
carefully
examining
them
for
any
sign
of
seams
or
lumpiness
No
they
looked
okay
Perfectly
formed
with
no
seams
One
thing
did
seem
odd
about
them
though
they
didn
t
move
at
all
They
stood
absolutely
still
like
statues
But
then
on
the
other
hand
Ernie
didn
t
really
know
that
much
about
horses
Maybe
they
were
supposed
to
stand
like
that
It
probably
didn
t
mean
anything
Oh
come
ON
said
Sterno
impatiently
Quit
making
such
an
issue
about
everything
Let
s
just
get
in
all
right
I
ve
had
it
with
walking
I
bet
you
must
be
dog
tired
right
said
the
Fly
Spare
me
your
attempts
at
humor
you
insectile
moron
Sterno
barked
The
Fly
looked
upset
What
did
he
mean
by
that
he
said
to
Ernie
Time
to
go
urged
the
Roman
All
aboard
ja
Sterno
and
the
Fly
quickly
scrambled
aboard
the
chariot
which
seemed
unusually
large
and
spacious
to
Ernie
He
got
on
as
well
in
spite
of
his
misgivings
Captain
Memory
brought
up
the
rear
The
other
three
Romans
then
got
on
behind
them
blocking
the
entrance
and
making
any
escape
impossible
Ernie
felt
very
uneasy
about
that
He
was
however
relieved
to
see
that
Captain
Memory
did
not
seem
the
least
bit
bothered
by
the
situation
But
then
Captain
Memory
didn
t
seem
the
least
bit
bothered
by
ANY
situation
Vell
avay
we
go
said
the
Roman
cheerfully
Giddap
He
snapped
the
reins
Nothing
happened
The
horses
stood
there
totally
immobile
The
Roman
laughed
nervously
Giddy
UP
He
lashed
the
horses
with
the
reins
Still
nothing
From
somewhere
in
his
toga
he
produced
a
riding
crop
and
began
lashing
the
horses
unmercifully
You
vill
MOVE
you
shtupid
animals
The
horses
stood
absolutely
still
totally
unresponsive
The
Roman
turned
to
the
foursome
with
a
nervous
laugh
A
liddle
problem
nothing
to
vorry
about
No
need
to
get
out
He
jumped
over
the
side
of
the
chariot
and
approached
the
horses
menacingly
Uh
Herr
Sturmbannfuhrer
one
of
the
other
Romans
spoke
up
There
is
something
ve
forgot
to
tell
you
The
first
Roman
gave
the
closest
horse
a
swift
kick
in
the
hind
leg
The
leg
broke
neatly
off
The
Roman
jumped
frantically
out
of
the
way
as
the
horse
toppled
slowly
over
and
crashed
to
the
pavement
shattering
into
a
million
pieces
The
first
Roman
turned
on
the
other
Romans
in
a
fury
Idiots
he
shrieked
You
brought
ze
plaster
horses
I
told
you
ve
must
have
ze
REAL
horses
But
but
Herr
Sturmbannfuhrer
the
second
Roman
sputtered
Ze
real
horses

make
doo
doo
on
ze
floor
Dummkopf
shrieked
the
first
Roman
How
can
ve
travel
vith
plaster
horses
The
other
three
Roman
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
Oh
Ve
didn
t
tink
of
dat
Idiots
The
first
Roman
lashed
the
others
with
his
riding
crop
Oh
man
said
the
Fly
sadly
Does
this
mean
we
re
gonna
have
to
walk
after
all
The
first
Roman
stopped
abruptly
and
turned
to
the
foursome
with
a
bright
smile
Oh
no
of
course
not
Dis
is
chust
a
minor
problem
ve
fix
in
chust
a
moment
The
Roman
pulled
some
sort
of
small
electronic
device
out
of
his
toga
and
scanned
the
surrounding
area
with
it
It
beeped
Ah
Ze
solution
to
our
problem
is
coming
right
down
ze
road
An
object
appeared
over
the
horizon
moving
quickly
down
the
road
in
their
direction
As
it
approached
Ernie
could
see
that
it
was
a
large
chariot
pulled
by
four
beautiful
white
horses
It
looked
somehow
familiar
The
four
Romans
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
blocking
the
path
as
the
chariot
aproached
The
man
in
the
chariot
stopped
confused
You
the
first
Roman
shouted
Out
of
ze
chariot
NOW
He
pulled
an
evil
looking
weapon
out
of
his
toga
and
pointed
it
at
the
man
in
the
chariot
menacingly
Make
way
Make
way
the
man
in
the
chariot
cried
out
I
have
no
time
to
waste
I
m
on
my
way
to
the
chariot
races
in
Rome
The
man
in
the
chariot
looked
very
familiar
to
Ernie
Could
it
be
Charlton
Heston
I
have
no
time
to
vaste
either
The
first
Roman
fired
his
weapon
at
the
man
in
the
chariot
who
vanished
in
a
flash
of
flame
Now
he
turned
to
Ernie
and
the
others
Ve
vill
take
ZIS
chariot
ja
Oh
man
said
the
Fly
mournfully
They
re
ruining
all
my
favorite
shows
First
Mr
Ed
falls
apart
and
now
they
disintegrate
Ben
Hur
Even
Sterno
was
now
beginning
to
get
suspicious
Say
he
said
to
the
first
Roman
What
s
your
name
anyway
My
name
the
first
Roman
seemed
nonplussed
You
vant
to
know
my
name
Yeah
Ernie
picked
the
question
up
What
s
your
name
The
first
Roman
laughed
nervously
He
elbowed
the
second
Roman
sharply
Quick
he
whispered
Vot
s
my
name
The
second
Roman
whispered
something
to
him
The
first
Roman
smiled
agreeably
Oh
yes
my
name
I
am
Marcus
Provolonicus
Sterno
froze
in
horror
Provolone
It
s
CHEESE
Oh
my
god
it
s
CHEESE
Run
The
other
three
Romans
suddenly
whipped
out
evil
looking
weapons
DO
NOT
MOVE
shrieked
the
first
Roman
Or
you
vill
suffer
ze
same
fate
as
our
friend
here
He
gestured
towards
the
other
chariot
which
now
contained
only
a
little
pile
of
ashes
The
first
Roman
tore
off
his
toga
revealing
a
Nazi
SS
uniform
underneath
So
our
liddle
subterfuge
does
not
fool
you
eh
he
said
menacingly
Dat
is
most
unfortunate
For
vhich
He
looked
around
quickly
His
eyes
came
to
rest
on
the
second
Roman
YOU
vill
pay
dummkopf
He
lashed
the
man
with
his
riding
crop
But
Herr
Sturmbannfuhrer
the
man
began
SILENCE
shrieked
von
Liederkranz
It
is
impossible
to
get
good
help
zese
days
he
sulked
Ze
quality
of
ze
Cyberslaves
is
not
vhat
it
used
to
be
He
turned
to
Ernie
and
the
others
Now
you
vill
get
on
zis
chariot
and
ve
vill
be
on
our
vay
Ernie
looked
at
von
Liederkranz
s
evil
looking
weapons
and
decided
to
do
it
the
Nazi
s
way
They
boarded
the
other
chariot
This
time
the
horses
worked
and
they
moved
off
quickly
down
the
road
Hey
this
sure
beats
walking
said
the
Fly
cheerfully
as
they
thundered
along
the
yellow
brick
road
I
dunno
said
Ernie
ruefully
Considering
where
we
re
going
maybe
we
d
rather
walk
Ernie
frowned
Say
he
said
to
von
Liederkranz
Where
ARE
we
going
