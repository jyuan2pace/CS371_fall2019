CHAPTER
Um
It
s
not
exactly
what
I
had
in
mind
Ernie
Ross
looked
ruefully
at
his
imitation
fur
loincloth
and
flimsy
plastic
broadsword
Um
I
sort
of
thought
The
girl
behind
the
counter
gave
Ernie
a
sour
look
You
wanted
to
play
the
Goombah
the
Barbarian
Virtual
Reality
Game
right
Uh
yeah
Ernie
replied
The
girl
examined
a
sheet
of
paper
cracking
her
gum
loudly
In
that
case
you
have
to
wear
the
fur
loincloth
and
carry
the
plastic
broadsword
It
says
so
right
here
Ernie
thought
about
this
Well
in
the
ad
it
said
that
playing
the
game
would
be
just
like
being
Goombah
the
Barbarian
There
d
be
monsters
and
wizards
and
everything
just
like
the
movie
That
s
correct
replied
the
girl
Here
at
the
Virtual
Arcade
we
offer
simulated
reality
games
of
just
about
any
popular
character
or
story
line
Our
huge
mainframe
computers
allow
us
to
synthesize
any
reality
in
amazingly
high
resolution
allowing
us
to
believably
create
stories
in
which
YOU
can
be
the
main
character
You
can
step
into
the
role
of
a
commando
a
swashbuckler
a
space
traveler
just
about
anything
that
any
popular
movie
or
book
has
featured
recently
You
can
act
out
the
role
of
your
favorite
character
doing
anything
that
character
could
You
can
actually
BE
your
favorite
fictional
character
You
can
live
out
your
fantasies
for
only
a
few
dollars
a
minute
She
seemed
to
reading
from
a
prepared
statement
Well
Ernie
was
still
unsure
He
had
heard
that
these
games
were
tremendous
fun
They
had
become
very
popular
in
the
last
few
years
You
could
now
find
a
Virtual
Arcade
at
just
about
any
major
shopping
mall
they
were
franchised
Of
course
you
had
to
pay
through
the
nose
to
play
but
nobody
seemed
to
mind
They
were
just
so
much
FUN
I
still
feel
silly
wearing
this
fur
loincloth
and
carrying
this
big
plastic
sword
complained
Ernie
That
s
what
Goombah
wears
in
the
movie
isn
t
it
the
girl
said
looking
bored
Well
The
girl
looked
at
the
clock
If
you
don
t
want
to
play
GOOMBAH
THE
BARBARIAN
I
can
let
you
play
KILLER
LESBIANS
FROM
OUTER
SPACE
instead
I
ve
got
a
game
starting
in
ten
minutes
No
no
that
s
okay
Ernie
protested
A
chime
sounded
Your
game
starts
in
five
minutes
The
girl
warned
Ernie
fluffing
her
hair
absently
Well
I
guess
I
m
stuck
with
this
Ernie
thought
I
paid
my
and
there
s
no
refund
I
hope
this
turns
out
to
be
worth
the
money
Ernie
was
after
all
just
a
college
student
and
didn
t
have
money
to
burn
The
chime
sounded
again
this
time
more
urgently
Second
door
on
your
right
the
girl
said
brightly
This
is
not
starting
off
well
at
all
Ernie
thought
as
he
headed
down
the
hallway
If
this
doesn
t
improve
real
quick
I
m
going
to
file
a
complaint
or
something
Ernie
entered
a
small
cubicle
A
technician
sat
him
down
in
a
large
comfortable
reclining
chair
and
fitted
him
with
the
stereo
goggles
and
headset
that
made
Virtual
Reality
come
alive
He
even
added
the
latest
refinement
tactile
sensation
electrodes
which
he
glued
to
Ernie
s
body
at
strategic
locations
As
Ernie
settled
into
the
new
visions
and
sensations
that
awaited
him
he
began
to
feel
somewhat
better
There
before
him
was
the
mysterious
landscape
that
Goombah
inhabited
in
the
movies
full
of
forbidding
crags
and
castles
shaped
like
skulls
Of
course
none
of
it
was
actually
there
but
the
illusion
was
amazingly
realistic
It
was
hard
to
believe
it
was
all
just
synthesized
artificial
reality
Ernie
was
impressed
Maybe
this
will
be
okay
after
all
he
thought
He
unsheathed
his
huge
plastic
broadsword
preparing
to
be
attacked
by
dragons
wizards
or
any
of
the
other
fearsome
mythological
characters
that
Goombah
customarily
battled
Suddenly
Ernie
heard
a
loud
high
pitched
bark
He
looked
down
and
saw
a
little
white
dog
with
a
black
spot
over
one
eye
The
dos
looked
up
at
him
expectantly
Ernie
was
not
prepared
for
something
like
this
I
m
supposed
to
be
Goombah
the
Barbarian
he
thought
Goombah
does
not
have
any
silly
little
dog
The
dog
suddenly
jumped
up
into
Ernie
s
arms
He
caught
it
automatically
It
peered
up
into
his
face
as
though
expecting
him
to
do
something
This
has
got
to
be
a
mistake
said
Ernie
to
himself
exasperatedly
This
dog
must
be
from
somebody
else
s
game
What
am
I
gonna
do
with
him
Before
he
could
think
about
the
problem
any
further
a
bright
light
in
the
sky
attracted
Ernie
s
attention
Here
it
comes
he
thought
gripping
his
broadsword
tightly
What
will
it
be
a
demon
a
flying
dragon
Ernie
strained
his
eyes
It
s
a
flying
saucer
Sure
enough
it
was
a
flying
saucer
looking
as
though
it
had
come
straight
from
an
old
s
science
fiction
movie
Ernie
was
taken
aback
There
weren
t
supposed
to
be
any
flying
saucers
in
Goombah
the
Barbarian
The
flying
saucer
quickly
landed
a
few
yards
in
front
of
Ernie
and
two
space
creatures
emerged
They
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
humanoid
reptiles
They
reminded
Ernie
of
giant
iguanas
The
dog
under
Ernie
s
arm
wriggled
uncomfortably
Ernie
frowned
Space
creatures
he
thought
What
am
I
supposed
to
do
with
space
creatures
This
isn
t
what
I
was
expecting
at
all
Ernie
frowned
What
kind
of
game
is
this
anyway
The
creatures
began
approaching
Ernie
Maybe
I
m
supposed
to
say
something
he
considered
Suddenly
an
idea
occurred
to
him
He
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
Klaatu
barada
nikto
he
announced
One
of
the
space
creatures
pulled
out
a
ray
gun
and
pointed
it
at
him
Hmm
thought
Ernie
Maybe
that
wasn
t
quite
the
right
thing
to
say
It
occurred
to
Ernie
that
a
strategic
retreat
might
be
a
good
idea
He
looked
around
quickly
Unfortunately
the
landscape
of
swirling
mists
and
forbidding
hills
didn
t
seem
to
contain
anyplace
to
retreat
to
Ernie
turned
back
to
the
creatures
Look
uh
what
I
said
about
Klaatu
I
didn
t
really
mean
The
creature
fired
Ernie
felt
himself
suddenly
stiffen
into
immobility
It
s
stunned
sir
Ernie
heard
one
creature
say
to
the
other
Good
load
it
onto
the
ship
The
two
creatures
lifted
Ernie
who
had
become
stiff
as
a
board
and
began
carrying
him
dog
and
all
toward
the
ship
In
spite
of
himself
Ernie
was
impressed
These
special
effects
are
fantastic
he
thought
I
wonder
how
they
do
that
Stunner
business
Suddenly
a
costumed
comic
book
character
appeared
complete
with
flowing
cape
and
a
big
red
M
on
his
chest
He
blocked
the
aliens
path
Unhand
that
barbarian
the
comic
book
character
boomed
The
space
creature
looked
at
each
other
in
confusion
Unhand
What
does
that
mean
Are
we
supposed
to
cut
off
his
hands
The
comic
book
character
looked
exasperated
Look
just
put
him
down
okay
he
said
in
a
much
more
conversational
tone
Put
him
down
Put
him
down
One
space
creature
looked
at
the
other
What
do
we
do
now
sir
Oh
I
don
t
know
the
other
creature
replied
Just
disintegrate
him
I
guess
They
drew
their
weapons
The
comic
book
character
looked
confused
Um
uh
The
creatures
advanced
menacingly
Suddenly
the
comic
book
character
shouted
what
seemed
to
Ernie
to
be
a
very
odd
thing
JMP
F
Instantly
the
entire
scene
vanished
Ernie
still
stiff
and
board
like
found
himself
unsupported
and
dropped
three
feet
to
land
with
a
thud
on
a
carpeted
floor
Hi
guy
Ernie
heard
someone
say
Howya
doin
Ernie
attempted
to
moan
but
discovered
that
he
was
still
quite
securely
frozen
Here
let
me
help
you
up
he
heard
the
same
voice
say
The
room
swung
into
view
as
he
felt
himself
lifted
up
and
placed
on
his
feet
like
a
statue
He
seemed
to
be
in
someone
s
living
room
The
owner
of
the
voice
came
into
view
It
was
the
comic
book
character
who
in
the
cold
light
of
day
appeared
to
be
a
pleasant
although
rather
vacuous
looking
fellow
of
indeterminate
age
Allow
me
to
introduce
myself
he
said
cheerfully
I
m
Captain
Memory
He
extended
a
hand
Ernie
instinctively
attempted
to
shake
the
man
s
hand
but
discovered
he
was
still
quite
frozen
It
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
still
carrying
the
silly
little
dog
which
was
also
frozen
The
man
dropped
his
outstretched
hand
embarrassedly
Hey
I
forgot
he
said
cheerfully
You
re
still
paralyzed
Hey
no
sweat
It
ll
wear
off
in
a
few
minutes
The
man
seated
himself
on
a
nearby
sofa
and
began
perusing
a
small
book
he
had
produced
from
somewhere
Ernie
of
course
continued
to
stand
where
he
was
immobilized
This
is
a
really
weird
game
Ernie
thought
The
special
effects
are
fantastic
but
the
story
line
is
bizarre
Like
what
am
I
supposed
to
do
now
After
about
fifteen
minutes
Ernie
s
little
finger
began
to
twitch
The
twitching
slowly
spread
across
his
hand
Finally
with
great
effort
Ernie
was
able
to
take
a
step
towards
the
comic
book
character
who
was
still
seated
on
the
sofa
reading
his
book
The
comic
book
character
looked
up
Ah
it
s
wearing
off
he
said
Are
you
feeling
okay
Ungph
said
Ernie
discovering
that
the
power
of
speech
was
slowly
returning
to
him
Captain
Memory
took
that
to
mean
yes
Good
good
he
replied
in
a
cheerful
tone
Wharf
gumg
om
Ernie
got
out
with
difficulty
You
re
probably
wondering
what
s
going
on
Yarf
Ernie
felt
something
sharp
digging
into
his
side
It
was
the
little
dog
trying
to
get
away
Unfortunately
that
arm
had
not
unfrozen
yet
Ernie
s
ability
to
speak
seemed
to
have
returned
All
right
so
what
IS
going
on
I
had
to
rescue
you
from
those
creatures
Captain
Memory
explained
They
were
taking
you
to
be
a
Cyberslave
in
the
mining
pits
Ernie
frowned
What
s
a
Cyberslave
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
They
were
going
to
force
you
to
operate
mining
robots
like
so
many
other
poor
fools
before
you
Like
you
they
thought
they
were
going
to
play
a
game
The
next
thing
they
knew
they
were
forced
into
a
life
of
virtual
hard
labor
operating
mining
robots
hours
a
day
days
a
week
until
finally
their
bodies
shrivelled
up
and
their
brains
burned
out
He
sighed
I
was
too
late
for
most
of
them
but
at
least
I
could
save
the
two
of
you
Ernie
shivered
Some
of
this
was
beginning
to
seem
a
little
too
real
Man
this
is
a
really
strange
game
he
said
I
m
not
complaining
mind
you
I
mean
the
special
effects
alone
make
it
worth
the
money
He
looked
around
He
seemed
to
be
in
a
huge
living
room
all
decorated
in
s
style
It
all
seemed
very
solid
and
believable
Ernie
couldn
t
help
being
impressed
I
mean
this
is
like
SO
realistic
It
s
just
that
I
m
having
a
real
hard
time
following
the
story
Like
what
is
supposed
to
be
happening
in
this
game
anyway
Captain
Memory
sighed
Look
I
m
trying
to
explain
this
to
you
It
s
NOT
a
game
okay
That
game
business
was
just
a
ruse
It
was
a
trap
to
get
you
to
come
in
and
hook
yourself
up
to
their
Virtual
Reality
system
Once
you
re
in
you
can
t
get
out
They
turn
you
into
a
Cyberslave
and
make
you
work
until
your
brain
burns
up
Oh
right
Ernie
caught
himself
I
get
it
You
re
not
supposed
to
admit
it
s
a
game
You
re
supposed
to
pretend
it
s
real
Okay
I
ll
play
along
So
what
now
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
I
can
see
this
isn
t
going
to
be
easy
He
thought
a
moment
Okay
if
this
is
a
game
you
should
be
able
to
quit
any
time
you
like
right
Uh
yeah
This
was
beginning
to
make
Ernie
uneasy
So
how
do
you
quit
the
Captain
demanded
Where
s
the
ESC
button
or
BREAK
or
whatever
HOW
do
you
get
out
Ernie
suddenly
realized
that
he
hadn
t
been
given
any
information
on
what
to
do
when
he
wanted
to
quit
playing
Uh
well
I
can
quit
anytime
I
want
he
said
defensively
Okay
try
Captain
Memory
demanded
Ernie
shuffled
uncomfortably
Well
maybe
I
m
not
ready
to
quit
yet
Try
it
just
to
see
what
happens
the
Captain
urged
Well
Ernie
considered
It
looks
like
I
got
into
the
wrong
game
here
I
wanted
to
play
GOOMBAH
THE
BARBARIAN
I
mean
no
offense
this
is
a
cool
game
and
everything
but
I
really
wanted
to
play
GOOMBAH
Captain
Memory
looked
upset
This
really
isn
t
a
game
Ernie
sighed
I
ll
tell
you
what
I
ll
just
give
up
on
this
for
today
and
I
ll
try
again
a
week
from
Thursday
okay
So
I
ll
just
be
heading
home
now
okay
Great
said
the
Captain
enthusiastically
Just
quit
right
now
okay
Well
okay
Ernie
agreed
halfheartedly
He
tried
to
think
of
what
to
do
Hello
he
called
up
into
the
air
Is
anybody
there
I
d
like
to
go
now
Nothing
happened
Ernie
s
heart
began
to
pound
Hey
c
mon
Isn
t
anybody
listening
to
me
I
said
I
wanna
GO
No
response
This
was
beginning
to
be
more
than
Ernie
felt
he
could
deal
with
Look
I
m
not
asking
for
my
money
back
or
anything
I
ll
you
know
try
again
some
other
time
I
just
want
to
go
home
okay
No
answer
Now
Ernie
really
DID
want
to
go
He
began
to
panic
Hey
isn
t
anybody
out
there
WAKE
UP
I
don
t
wanna
play
anymore
I
wanna
go
home
He
wailed
I
WANT
MY
MOMMY
Nothing
All
right
all
right
calm
down
Captain
Memory
tried
to
soothe
Ernie
We
ll
get
you
out
of
here
It
s
just
going
to
take
a
little
time
Ernie
s
left
arm
unfroze
convulsively
dumping
the
little
dog
on
the
floor
It
growled
unpleasantly
Why
can
t
you
get
me
out
of
here
NOW
he
demanded
petulantly
The
Captain
shrugged
Hey
I
don
t
run
this
show
I
was
lucky
I
could
even
get
you
away
from
those
creatures
Getting
out
is
another
story
altogether
Oh
this
is
awful
Ernie
wailed
He
still
wasn
t
entirely
sure
whether
this
was
a
game
or
not
but
whatever
it
was
he
didn
t
like
it
anymore
Maybe
you
d
better
sit
down
Captain
Memory
moved
over
to
one
side
of
the
sofa
Ernie
decided
that
sitting
down
was
probably
a
good
idea
and
did
so
This
was
beginning
to
get
altogether
too
real
Anyway
it
could
be
worse
How
Ernie
moaned
You
could
be
like
that
poor
guy
over
there
the
Captain
said
gesturing
towards
the
dog
I
don
t
need
your
sympathy
the
dog
snapped
Ernie
started
A
talking
dog
This
is
unbelievable
What
next
Yeah
yeah
the
dog
snarled
Believe
me
you
don
t
look
so
hot
in
that
ridiculous
fur
loincloth
either
Goombah
the
Barbarian
I
m
sure
The
dog
pulled
a
cigar
out
of
some
invisible
pocket
and
began
to
smoke
it
holding
it
in
his
front
paw
in
a
very
un
canine
manner
Ernie
was
suddenly
very
conscious
of
his
loincloth
He
looked
at
the
dog
What
what
See
what
I
mean
the
Captain
gestured
towards
the
dog
In
Virtual
Reality
you
can
be
anybody
or
anything
You
re
lucky
you
came
through
as
yourself
You
could
have
wound
up
like
him
as
a
dog
The
dog
made
a
wry
expression
Yeah
right
Or
like
YOU
He
looked
the
Captain
up
and
down
A
super
hero
he
said
sarcastically
Captain
Memory
seemed
nonplussed
Well
what
s
wrong
with
that
I
m
sure
the
replied
Okay
what
super
powers
have
you
got
The
Captain
seemed
defensive
Well
I
do
have
some
powers
Like
what
Well
the
Captain
thought
a
moment
Like
I
program
in
Assembler
and
he
doesn
t
Wait
a
minute
Ernie
was
confused
WHO
doesn
t
Why
the
man
behind
all
this
of
course
the
Captain
explained
The
evil
genius
Waldo
Stadium
Oh
I
get
it
Ernie
brightened
This
really
is
a
game
right
Captain
Memory
sighed
exasperatedly
Look
for
the
last
time
this
is
NOT
a
game
The
evil
genius
Waldo
Stadium
has
embarked
on
a
plan
to
take
over
the
entire
world
s
computing
power
He
s
been
breaking
into
people
s
systems
one
at
a
time
taking
control
of
them
and
linking
them
to
his
other
systems
to
create
a
vast
network
that
grows
more
powerful
all
the
time
When
he
takes
over
a
system
he
establishes
complete
control
over
anything
and
anybody
that
happens
to
be
in
it
at
the
time
That
s
how
you
fell
into
his
clutches
He
s
taken
over
the
Virtual
Arcades
anyone
who
was
playing
a
Virtual
Reality
games
there
is
now
his
Cyberslave
Oh
man
Ernie
sank
his
head
into
his
hands
This
was
just
too
much
to
handle
Suddenly
a
thought
occurred
to
him
So
how
did
we
get
here
anyway
He
gestured
to
the
room
around
them
Captain
Memory
pulled
himself
up
to
his
full
height
I
brought
you
here
he
said
proudly
He
turned
to
the
dog
See
I
told
you
I
had
powers
Great
said
the
dog
sarcastically
So
where
are
we
anyway
We
re
in
Virtual
Reality
the
Captain
explained
You
know
Cyberspace
Wait
a
minute
Ernie
was
finding
this
all
hard
to
follow
If
we
re
still
in
the
computer
doesn
t
that
mean
that
this
guy
Waldo
Supermarket
has
control
over
us
Stadium
Captain
Memory
corrected
Whatever
Ernie
said
exasperatedly
What
about
my
question
Who
s
in
control
here
Ah
that
the
beauty
of
it
explained
the
Captain
warming
to
his
subject
He
s
been
taking
over
systems
so
fast
that
he
can
t
keep
track
of
them
He
doesn
t
even
know
what
he
s
got
Remember
when
he
takes
over
a
system
he
gets
EVERYTHING
that
was
in
it
He
s
got
games
spreadsheets
database
files
and
hundreds
of
different
Virtual
Realities
all
mixed
together
in
no
order
That
s
what
gives
us
our
window
of
opportunity
We
can
hide
out
in
areas
he
doesn
t
even
know
he
s
got
until
we
figure
out
how
to
bring
this
diabolical
scheme
to
a
halt
Ernie
thought
about
this
Okay
we
re
in
Cyberspace
Right
But
where
in
Cyberspace
The
Captain
slumped
Well
I
don
t
exactly
know
The
dog
snickered
Some
super
hero
Well
well
I
was
under
a
lot
of
pressure
The
Captain
said
defensively
Those
creatures
would
have
had
you
in
another
second
So
I
just
picked
a
location
at
random
and
JUMPed
to
it
You
JUMPed
to
it
Ernie
was
confused
How
do
you
do
that
That
s
the
beauty
of
Assembler
the
Captain
answered
enthusiastically
You
can
do
stuff
like
that
Now
with
a
high
level
language
you
d
never
be
able
to
do
stuff
like
that
You
can
only
do
what
the
language
says
you
can
do
In
Assembler
you
can
do
ANYTHING
Captain
Memory
chuckled
That
s
Waldo
s
weak
point
He
refuses
to
learn
Assembler
He
insists
you
can
do
all
this
stuff
in
C
or
whatever
language
he
using
now
Well
we
ll
show
Suddenly
the
dog
broke
in
At
RANDOM
he
barked
You
JUMPed
at
RANDOM
Well
the
Captain
was
taken
aback
You
mean
the
dog
continued
We
could
have
wound
up
in
the
middle
of
a
SPREADSHEET
Ernie
tried
to
imagine
life
in
a
spreadsheet
It
didn
t
sound
too
appealing
It
was
a
chance
I
had
to
take
Captain
Memory
explained
defensively
Great
the
dog
snarled
You
take
chances
with
our
lives
Okay
okay
the
Captain
said
placatingly
I
ve
got
a
better
location
He
rummaged
furiously
through
the
pockets
in
his
costume
I
wrote
it
down
it
s
here
somewhere
he
continued
searching
Um
no
um
AHA
He
brandished
a
small
slip
of
paper
in
the
air
Here
it
is
He
read
the
paper
aloud
It
s
INSPECTED
BY
NO
Some
super
hero
the
dog
repeated
The
Captain
frowned
Well
maybe
that
s
not
the
right
one
He
continued
to
rummage
through
his
pockets
I
m
sure
I
had
it
here
somewhere
Ernie
looked
askance
at
the
comic
book
character
You
don
t
REMEMBER
it
Captain
Memory
fidgeted
uncomfortably
Hey
it
s
not
easy
to
remember
a
long
string
of
numbers
in
Hex
you
know
I
m
doing
the
best
I
can
Ernie
moaned
quietly
This
