anyway
Von
Liederkranz
smiled
evilly
You
ll
find
out
soon
enough
Ernie
looked
on
ahead
They
appeared
to
be
approaching
something
Oh
it
s
a
town
said
the
Fly
Vot
von
Liederkranz
snapped
Dere
s
not
supposed
to
be
a
town
here
Whoa
He
stopped
the
chariot
Vhere
s
my
map
He
pulled
out
a
map
and
began
regarding
it
carefully
Ah
here
s
de
problem
Ve
get
on
ze
autobahn
und
turn
left
at
Heidelberg
The
other
Romans
had
removed
their
togas
as
well
and
stood
revealed
as
Nazi
SS
troopers
One
of
them
peered
over
von
Liederkranz
s
shoulder
Uh
Herr
Sturmbannfuhrer
he
began
tentatively
Dat
s
a
map
of
Bavaria
Von
Liederkranz
started
He
looked
at
the
legend
of
the
map
and
then
crumpled
it
up
angrily
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
I
know
dat
he
snapped
I
vas
chust
testing
you
Very
good
He
prodded
the
SS
trooper
with
his
riding
crop
Okay
Mr
Know

all
vhere
do
ve
go
now
The
trooper
regarded
the
road
carefully
Vell
since
dere
s
only
one
road
and
dis
isn
t
de
right
vay
I
vould
say
ve

way
Von
Liederkranz
thought
a
minute
Uh
right
De
other
vay
Ve
go
de
other
vay
He
wheeled
the
chariot
around
and
they
galloped
off
in
the
other
direction
They
charged
on
down
the
yellow
brick
road
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
in
the
first
place
moving
faster
this
time
as
von
Liederkranz
whipped
the
horses
bad
temperedly
After
some
time
they
began
to
approach
what
seemed
to
be
a
town
Oh
wow
said
the
Fly
It
s
the
same
town
How
did
we
get
to
the
same
place
when
we
went
the
opposite
direction
I
told
you
so
smirked
Sterno
All
Roads
Lead
to
Rome
You
re
just
going
to
have
to
go
there
There
s
just
no
getting
out
of
it
Von
Liederkranz
peered
ahead
Gottverdammter
Vhere
s
my
map
He
pulled
out
another
map
and
regarded
it
carefully
Ah
Here
s
ze
problem
Ve
chust
get
on
I
turn
right
at
Indianapolis
The
SS
trooper
looked
over
von
Liederkranz
s
shoulder
again
Uh
Herr
Sturmbannfuhrer
dat
s
a
map
of
Illinois
Von
Liederkranz
started
He
quickly
crumpled
up
the
map
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
I
know
dat
He
turned
to
the
rest
of
the
group
Ve
are
going
to
zis
town
Ve
intended
to
go
to
zis
town
It
vas
NOT
a
mistake
They
continued
down
the
road
and
into
town
The
town
consisted
of
one
unpaved
road
flanked
by
one
story
wooden
buildings
with
broad
fronts
Their
names
were
clearly
legible
on
them
SALOON
GENERAL
STORE
U
S
MARSHAL
The
town
looked
somehow
familiar
to
Ernie
Oh
wow
exclaimed
the
Fly
It
s
Dodge
City
That
s
impossible
snorted
Sterno
You
can
t
have
All
Roads
Lead
to
Dodge
City
That
s
not
right
I
have
a
classical
education
and
I
know
Could
be
Abilene
I
suppose
mused
Ernie
All
Roads
Lead
to
Abilene
said
Sterno
sarcastically
Fat
chance
You
must
be
right
Ernie
agreed
I
don
t
see
any
cattle
around
Must
be
Dodge
City
after
all
As
they
passed
through
town
Ernie
noticed
a
tall
thin
young
man
who
looked
at
them
with
alarm
The
young
man
began
hurrying
towards
the
U
S
Marshal
s
office
walking
with
a
pronounced
limp
Mr
Dillon
Mr
Dillon
Somethin
strange
comin
into
town
he
cried
A
tall
imposing
man
dressed
in
Western
attire
and
wearing
a
U
S
Marshal
badge
stepped
out
of
the
marshal
s
office
and
into
the
street
blocking
the
path
of
the
chariot
Hold
up
there
now
What
do
you
boys
want
in
our
town
Get
out
of
my
vay
hissed
von
Liederkranz
I
haff
no
time
for
dis
shtupidity
Now
hold
on
just
a
minute
there
the
Marshal
began
Idiot
snapped
von
Liederkranz
He
turned
to
the
SS
troopers
Disintegrate
him
von
Liederkranz
and
the
SS
troopers
reached
for
their
evil
looking
weapons
With
lightning
speed
the
Marshal
s
gun
flew
into
his
hand
Four
shots
rand
out
catching
each
of
the
Nazis
full
in
the
chest
the
force
of
the
bullet
hurling
their
bodies
from
the
chariot
I
seen
it
Mr
Dillon
cried
Chester
the
young
man
with
the
limp
They
drew
first
Ernie
threw
his
hands
up
over
his
head
Don
t
shoot
We
re
unarmed
Sterno
get
down
on
all
fours
Woof
he
said
emphatically
They
don
t
shoot
dogs
do
they
They
were
holding
us
prisoner
the
Fly
chimed
in
They
shot
Ben
Hur
Ben
who
The
Marshal
looked
confused
Just
then
a
woman
in
an
elaborate
red
dress
ran
out
of
the
saloon
Oh
Matt
Are
you
all
right
I
heard
the
shooting
Don
t
you
worry
Miss
Kitty
I
m
just
fine
the
Marshal
reassured
her
Ernie
looked
at
the
ground
behind
him
The
bloody
bodies
of
von
Liederkranz
and
the
other
Nazis
were
lying
motionless
in
the
dust
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Are
they
really
dead
Oh
yes
said
Captain
Memory
cheerfully
Too
bad
they
won
t
stay
that
way
Huh
Ernie
was
confused
Well
you
know
how
it
is
in
computer
games
the
Captain
went
on
If
you
get
killed
you
just
start
over
again
with
another
life
I
dunno
they
looked
pretty
dead
to
me
Ernie
said
Look
again
the
Captain
advised
Ernie
turned
The
bodies
had
vanished
See
the
Captain
said
They
ve
gone
back
to
the
beginning
They
ll
have
to
start
all
over
Ernie
turned
back
to
look
at
the
Marshal
who
had
been
conferring
with
Miss
Kitty
and
Chester
You
boys
are
free
to
go
the
Marshal
said
Just
stay
out
of
trouble
He
went
back
into
his
office
Whew
the
Fly
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Boy
are
we
lucky
to
get
out
of
that
one
You
don
t
want
to
mess
with
Marshal
Dillon
Sterno
stood
back
up
and
brushed
himself
off
trying
to
recover
his
lost
dignity
You
can
put
your
hands
down
now
he
said
to
Ernie
snappishly
You
have
no
idea
how
ridiculous
you
look
surrendering
when
there
s
no
one
there
Oh
Ernie
lowered
his
hands
He
looked
around
So
what
are
we
gonna
do
in
Dodge
City
The
Fly
looked
at
the
Saloon
Look
at
all
those
pretty
girls
in
there
Whaddya
say
we
go
in
for
a
drink
Well
okay
Ernie
couldn
t
think
of
any
reason
not
to
Besides
his
throat
was
feeling
pretty
dusty
after
that
long
chariot
ride
They
got
out
of
the
chariot
and
walked
towards
the
saloon
the
Fly
leading
the
way
They
walked
up
to
the
doors
when
suddenly
their
way
was
blocked
by
a
burly
bartender
Hold
it
right
there
boys
We
don
t
allow
no
Injuns
in
here
Huh
The
Fly
was
confused
That
means
you
The
bartender
prodded
the
Fly
in
the
chest
Imagine
that
trying
to
come
in
here
with
feathers
he
gestured
toward
the
Fly
s
antenna
and
a
war
mask
He
gestured
towards
the
Fly
s
face
The
dance
hall
girls
laughed
derisively
Hey
wait
a
minute
the
Fly
protested
I
m
not
A
shotgun
suddenly
appeared
in
the
bartender
s
hands
I
said
Git
he
said
menacingly
NOW
Okay
okay
the
Fly
backed
off
I
m
gittin
And
don
t
come
back
the
bartender
called
after
them
The
Fly
sighed
as
the
foursome
walked
back
to
the
chariot
Aw
gee
I
never
get
to
have
any
fun
CHAPTER
The
foursome
walked
slowly
back
towards
Ben
Hur
s
chariot
Suddenly
the
lead
horse
reared
up
whinnying
loudly
and
the
four
horses
galloped
out
of
town
as
fast
as
they
could
run
the
empty
chariot
bouncing
along
behind
them
Ernie
was
totally
taken
aback
by
this
Hey
they
started
up
all
by
themselves
he
said
as
the
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
the
horse
s
hooves
drifted
over
them
Can
they
do
that
Well
obviously
they
can
Sterno
sneered
And
it
s
all
your
fault
MY
fault
Ernie
coughed
Why
is
it
MY
fault
Because
it
s
always
your
fault
Sterno
snapped
YOU
didn
t
tie
them
up
Me
Ernie
protested
I
didn
t
know
you
had
to
tie
them
up
Can
t
you
just
like
turn
them
off
or
something
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
Hopeless
Captain
Memory
looked
up
at
the
bright
afternoon
sun
Nice
day
for
a
walk
don
t
you
think
Ernie
looked
down
the
road
It
seemed
to
stretch
endlessly
through
a
scrubby
dusty
semi
desert
landscape
It
looked
exactly
like
the
scenery
he
d
seen
in
hundreds
of
episodes
of
Gunsmoke
It
did
not
look
like
a
pleasant
place
for
a
walk
Maybe
we
could
just
stay
here
he
suggested
hopefully
Just
then
Marshal
Dillon
stepped
out
of
his
office
You
boys
better
get
movin
before
you
get
into
more
trouble
he
said
sternly
I
want
you
out
of
town
before
sunset
Ernie
sighed
Well
okay
maybe
we
won
t
stay
here
then
The
foursome
started
off
down
the
road
occasionally
glancing
over
their
shoulders
to
see
if
the
Marshal
was
still
watching
them
Unfortunately
he
was
After
what
seemed
like
hours
they
approached
a
fork
in
the
road
One
branch
seemed
to
head
off
into
the
mountains
and
another
into
the
valley
They
stopped
Ernie
looked
at
both
branches
of
the
road
Well
which
way
do
we
go
The
high
road
or
the
low
road
I
know
the
Fly
chimed
in
brightly
You
take
the
high
road
and
I
ll
take
the
low
road
Why
Because
then
I
ll
be
in
Scotland
afore
ye
The
Fly
beamed
Gimme
a
break
moaned
Ernie
Wait
a
minute
Captain
Memory
interrupted
What
Maybe
the
Captain
could
come
up
with
something
that
would
get
them
out
of
this
desolate
landscape
Isn
t
it
supposed
to
be
you
ll
take
the
low
road
and
I
ll
take
the
high
road
The
Fly
frowned
No
I
m
sure
it
s
supposed
to
be
you
take
the
high
road
and
I
ll
take
the
low
road
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
No
I
think
it
s
the
other
way
around
No
it
can
t
be
the
Fly
answered
Listen
He
started
to
sing
You
ll
take
the
high
road
That
s
enough
already
Sterno
broke
in
What
difference
does
it
make
anyway
We
re
not
going
to
Scotland
Ernie
looked
around
Okay
then
where
are
we
going
Rome
stated
Sterno
confidently
All
Roads
Lead
to
Rome
Ernie
regarded
the
landscape
skeptically
I
dunno
Rome
that
s
in
Italy
right
This
doesn
t
look
like
Italy
to
me
It
looks
like
He
stopped
Like
what
Sterno
demanded
Like
well
well
I
don
t
know
what
it
looks
like
but
it
doesn
t
look
like
Italy
It
s
pointless
to
argue
with
me
said
Sterno
pompously
Because
I
have
a
classical
education
and
I
am
therefore
always
right
Aren
t
there
supposed
to
be
like
grapes
and
pizzas
and
people
playing
those
little
accordions
Ernie
wondered
No
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
The
Fly
looked
down
the
road
into
the
valley
and
up
the
road
into
the
mountains
Okay
so
which
way
do
we
go
then
It
doesn
t
matter
said
Sterno
self
importantly
All
Roads
Lead
to
Rome
The
Fly
started
up
the
road
into
the
mountains
You
guys
can
go
any
way
you
want
he
called
back
over
his
shoulder
But
I
m
going
this
way
Why
Ernie
called
after
him
Cause
then
I
ll
be
in
Scotland
afore
ye
The
Fly
laughed
and
started
running
Last
one
there
is
a
rotten
egg
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
and
Sterno
Well
he
said
at
last
I
guess
we
might
as
well
follow
him
I
ll
say
Captain
Memory
agreed
I
wouldn
t
want
him
to
be
in
Scotland
afore
me
The
three
of
them
turned
and
began
walking
up
the
road
into
the
mountains
The
road
headed
upward
at
a
moderate
angle
making
walking
somewhat
difficult
They
began
to
notice
the
terrain
around
them
changing
as
they
walked
They
seemed
to
be
moving
into
a
cooler
moister
environment
The
desert
was
giving
way
to
cool
Alpine
meadows
The
road
narrowed
into
a
path
threading
it
s
way
between
the
growing
hills
Actually
Ernie
thought
It
s
kind
of
nice
here
Maybe
taking
the
high
road
was
a
good
idea
They
had
not
seen
the
Fly
for
quite
some
time
but
they
were
fairly
confident
that
he
was
just
a
bit
out
of
sight
ahead
of
them
since
they
could
hear
someone
singing
I
ll
take
the
high
road
in
the
distance
Suddenly
the
singing
stopped
Ernie
frowned
He
hoped
the
Fly
hadn
t
fallen
over
a
cliff
or
something
He
strained
his
ears
No
no
singing
Suddenly
he
heard
another
sound
Did
you
hear
that
he
said
to
Sterno
Of
course
said
Sterno
assuredly
Ernie
frowned
What
did
that
sound
like
to
you
I
believe
it
was
Yodellay
he
hoo
Sterno
replied
Ernie
knitted
his
brow
in
concentration
I
ve
heard
that
before
That
reminds
me
of
something
Like
what
asked
Sterno
with
a
slight
air
of
sarcasm
Fondue
perhaps
Chocolate
Watches
Heidi
Ernie
brightened
Switzerland
We
re
in
Switzerland
Very
good
applauded
Sterno
Go
to
the
head
of
the
class
Ernie
frowned
again
So
what
are
we
doing
in
Switzerland
Captain
Memory
shrugged
We
seem
to
have
wandered
into
somebody
s
Geography
program
So
now
what
We
go
on
to
Rome
of
course
Sterno
answered
confidently
Ernie
looked
at
the
rising
mountains
and
Alpine
meadows
around
them
Are
you
sure
we
re
going
the
right
way
I
mean
are
we
supposed
to
go
through
Switzerland
to
get
to
Rome
Of
course
said
Sterno
with
great
assurance
Don
t
you
remember
Hannibal
taking
his
elephants
through
the
Alps
on
his
way
to
Rome
Hannibal
Ernie
s
face
lit
up
with
recognition
I
saw
that
movie
Starring
Victor
Mature
right
Ernie
looked
at
the
narrow
path
on
which
they
stood
and
frowned
What
are
we
gonna
do
if
we
run
into
an
elephant
on
this
trail
At
that
moment
they
turned
a
corner
and
came
upon
the
Fly
who
was
standing
still
looking
at
something
Hi
guys
he
said
Take
a
look
at
this
The
trail
at
this
pointed
rounded
a
curve
at
the
top
of
a
cliff
The
Fly
pointed
over
the
side
into
the
valley
below
There
was
some
sort
of
commotion
going
on
in
the
valley
There
seemed
to
be
a
large
crowd
of
some
sort
moving
through
the
valley
carrying
torches
Ernie
peered
into
the
valley
There
were
a
lot
of
people
or
animals
or
something
moving
around
but
he
couldn
t
make
out
what
they
were
doing
Another
cattle
drive
he
suggested
I
doubt
it
remarked
Sterno
Look
at
all
those
torches
Must
be
a
torch
drive
the
Fly
said
brightly
Sterno
glared
at
the
Fly
and
muttered
something
unintelligible
Those
torches
sure
are
pretty
aren
t
they
commented
Captain
Memory
Maybe
we
should
go
down
and
join
the
party
Ernie
could
hear
some
kind
of
chanting
drifting
up
from
the
valley
He
strained
to
hear
what
they
were
saying
It
seemed
to
be
something
like
Oom
alla
boom
He
frowned
Somehow
he
just
didn
t
like
the
look
of
that
crowd
Uh
maybe
we
d
better
not
he
countered
Sterno
agreed
with
him
Maybe
another
time
the
dog
suggested
Captain
Memory
looked
at
the
others
You
guys
are
no
fun
he
complained
The
foursome
watched
the
commotion
below
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
continued
along
the
trail
The
narrow
trail
wound
along
between
huge
boulders
making
it
impossible
to
see
very
far
ahead
The
foursome
passed
through
a
narrow
opening
and
found
themselves
facing
a
large
open
field
which
seemed
to
stretch
on
for
miles
In
the
middle
of
this
space
was
a
large
English
style
mansion
surrounded
by
carefully
tended
grounds
The
foursome
approached
it
A
low
ornamental
fence
surrounded
the
grounds
A
road
led
through
the
fence
and
up
to
the
front
door
Lacking
any
better
ideas
the
foursome
walked
down
the
road
and
up
to
the
front
door
The
door
was
massive
and
imposing
with
a
huge
cast
iron
door
knocker
in
the
middle
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
Captain
Memory
looked
at
the
Fly
The
Fly
looked
at
Sterno
Sterno
looked
at
Ernie
Ernie
looked
around
Everyone
was
looking
at
him
Ernie
sighed
and
stepped
up
to
the
door
Tentatively
he
raised
the
knocker
and
let
it
drop
It
made
a
surprisingly
loud
sound
Ernie
flinched
He
waited
Nothing
happened
Try
it
again
Sterno
demanded
Ernie
frowned
Why
don
t
you
try
it
He
had
a
bad
feeling
about
this
place
It
looked
like
someplace
he
had
seen
in
a
movie
sometime
He
didn
t
remember
what
movie
it
was
or
what
happened
but
it
was
something
bad
Well
obviously
I
m
not
tall
enough
to
reach
it
said
Sterno
patronizingly
Anyway
it
s
your
job
Why
is
it
my
job
cried
Ernie
indignantly
Why
is
it
always
my
job
You
started
it
retorted
Sterno
Ernie
sighed
He
knew
there
would
be
some
reason
why
it
was
his
job
He
always
got
stuck
with
things
like
this
Who
knows
what
kind
of
horrible
creature
would
answer
the
door
Even
if
it
was
a
normal
person
what
was
he
supposed
to
say
to
them
anyway
Oh
well
might
as
well
get
it
over
with
He
raised
the
knocker
and
slammed
it
down
several
times
raising
a
tremendous
din
that
no
one
in
the
house
could
have
missed
They
waited
Nothing
happened
Well
nobody
s
home
said
Ernie
lightly
I
guess
we
might
as
well
go
Oh
come
ON
snapped
Sterno
irritatedly
Where
are
we
supposed
to
go
anyway
Try
the
doorknob
Ernie
shifted
the
coffee
maker
to
his
other
hand
and
gingerly
touched
the
huge
cast
iron
doorknob
half
expecting
an
explosion
or
an
electric
shock
Nothing
happened
He
tried
to
turn
it
It
was
very
securely
locked
and
totally
unmovable
Well
door
s
locked
said
Ernie
in
a
cheerful
tone
Might
as
well
go
We
ll
find
another
way
in
said
Sterno
sternly
Let
s
walk
around
the
building
Ernie
grimaced
The
others
however
seemed
content
to
follow
Sterno
as
he
headed
off
around
the
corner
to
the
left
Ernie
supposed
there
was
no
way
to
get
out
of
this
so
he
followed
as
well
bringing
up
the
rear
A
small
garden
path
led
around
the
corner
of
the
building
through
the
English
garden
and
to
a
nicely
tended
stone
patio
French
doors
led
from
the
house
to
the
patio
Just
as
I
thought
Sterno
declared
He
strode
purposefully
up
to
the
doors
and
tried
the
knob
They
were
unlocked
He
led
the
way
into
the
house
They
found
themselves
in
a
luxurious
English
style
study
the
walls
panelled
with
dark
oak
and
lined
with
shelves
containing
leather
bound
books
Sterno
headed
immediately
for
a
small
occasional
table
by
the
wall
Aha
he
cried
I
knew
it
He
flipped
open
a
dark
wood
box
revealing
a
store
of
excellent
cigars
He
grabbed
a
handful
of
them
lighting
one
immediately
Ahhh
He
exhaled
a
cloud
of
blue
smoke
His
eyes
lit
upon
a
decanter
sitting
next
to
the
humidor
Lovely
he
exclaimed
Brandy
anyone
Ernie
sighed
wearily
All
this
stress
was
just
too
much
for
him
he
decided
Luckily
there
was
a
large
overstuffed
Victorian
sofa
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
room
Ernie
dropped
heavily
onto
it
followed
by
Captain
Memory
and
the
Fly
Captain
Memory
scanned
the
room
slowly
I
wonder
where
they
keep
their
TV
he
said
pensively
The
sofa
faced
to
large
oak
doors
which
Ernie
supposed
must
lead
to
the
rest
of
the
house
Ernie
considered
them
wondering
if
they
should
try
to
explore
the
house
further
No
he
decided
let
s
just
leave
well
enough
alone
At
that
moment
the
doors
flew
open
In
the
doorway
stood
a
tall
very
British
looking
gentleman
with
a
white
handlebar
mustache
wearing
a
smoking
jacket
and
a
top
hat
How
good
of
you
to
come
he
announced
jovially
I
m
Lord
Foofaraw
Do
make
yourselves
at
home
Tea
anyone
A
butler
entered
carrying
a
silver
tray
full
of
teacups
and
three
large
covered
silver
dishes
Ernie
gratefully
accepted
a
cup
of
tea
and
peeked
under
the
covers
of
the
dishes
The
first
two
contained
unappetizing
looking
little
ornamental
sandwiches
They
seemed
to
be
made
of
plastic
or
some
other
not
entirely
edible
material
At
this
point
however
Ernie
was
so
ravenously
hungry
he
would
have
eaten
practically
anything
even
items
that
were
only
marginally
edible
However
Ernie
decided
to
check
the
third
dish
What
luck
It
contained
a
large
pile
of
fresh
hot
sizzling
lamb
chops
broiled
to
perfection
Ernie
loved
lamb
chops
He
grabbed
the
entire
dish
off
the
tray
and
began
wolfing
them
down
eating
them
with
his
bare
hands
As
Ernie
s
hunger
subsided
he
began
to
feel
self
conscious
They
seemed
to
be
having
an
elegant
English
tea
with
