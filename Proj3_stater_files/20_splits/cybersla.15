a
titled
British
nobleman
and
here
he
was
wearing
a
fur
loincloth
carrying
a
plastic
broadsword
and
a
coffee
maker
and
eating
lamb
chops
with
his
bare
hands
It
didn
t
seem
proper
to
Ernie
Certainly
it
was
very
un
British
Ernie
frowned
Then
on
the
other
hand
it
wasn
t
his
fault
Lord
Foofaraw
was
the
one
who
served
the
lamb
chops
They
shouldn
t
serve
lamb
chops
if
they
don
t
want
people
to
eat
them
And
anyway
they
didn
t
give
him
any
utensils
so
he
had
to
eat
them
with
his
hands
That
settled
Ernie
returned
to
stuffing
his
face
with
chops
Pip
pip
Cheerio
Eh
wot
said
Lord
Foofaraw
jovially
How
very
British
exclaimed
Sterno
delightedly
Rather
agreed
Lord
Foofaraw
Ernie
turned
to
the
nobleman
I
wonder
if
you
could
tell
us
where
we
are
he
managed
to
ask
between
bites
Where
you
ARE
Lord
Foofaraw
seemed
amazed
Why
I
should
think
that
would
be
quite
obvious
You
re
HERE
old
boy
Sterno
chuckled
The
Fly
waved
his
antennae
confusedly
Captain
Memory
continued
to
look
around
for
a
TV
Lord
Foofaraw
settled
comfortably
into
an
overstuffed
chair
Ah
yes
he
began
This
reminds
me
of
the
time
I
was
lost
in
the
jungles
of
Poodawumpus
surrounded
by
cannibals
He
leaned
forward
animatedly
There
were
cannibals
to
the
right
of
me
cannibals
to
the
left
of
me
The
light
of
their
torches
flickered
through
the
dense
undergrowth
I
could
hear
their
infernal
chanting
Oom
alla
boom
Oom
alla
boom
Over
and
over
until
I
thought
the
infernal
din
should
surely
drive
me
mad
Suddenly
I
He
broke
off
looking
at
Ernie
oddly
I
say
my
good
man
why
ever
are
you
carrying
that
coffee
maker
Ernie
fidgeted
uncomfortably
It
s
not
a
coffee
maker
it
s
a
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
A
WOT
the
lord
was
amazed
A
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
Ernie
repeated
Lord
Foofaraw
looked
at
him
skeptically
Ernie
looked
again
at
the
device
he
was
carrying
He
sighed
On
the
other
hand
it
could
be
a
coffee
maker
too
I
suppose
Ernie
admitted
Anyway
it
s
genuine
Bakelite
Ah
yes
Bakelite
the
lord
seemed
to
consider
this
answer
reasonable
A
faraway
look
came
into
his
eyes
That
reminds
me
of
the
time
I
was
trekking
through
the
desert
of
Duzzlebuggy
But
what
about
the
cannibals
the
Fly
broke
in
his
antennae
waving
excitedly
Don
t
interrupt
His
Lordship
snapped
Sterno
Lord
Foofaraw
looked
confused
I
say
old
man
there
are
no
cannibals
in
the
deserts
of
Duzzlebuggy
The
Fly
s
antennae
drooped
disappointedly
I
wanted
to
hear
about
the
cannibals
Oh
dear
The
lord
seemed
quite
flustered
by
all
these
interruptions
Where
was
I
Ah
yes
there
I
was
scaling
the
mountains
of
Muffiedump
Ernie
s
mind
wandered
He
noticed
a
beautiful
silver
bell
sitting
on
an
end
table
next
to
him
It
seemed
to
be
a
very
unusual
design
It
was
covered
with
dozens
of
tiny
pushbuttons
each
with
an
odd
little
symbol
next
to
it
Ernie
picked
it
up
curiously
BONG
BONG
Loud
synthesized
bell
sounds
appeared
as
though
out
of
nowhere
Lord
Foofaraw
looked
up
in
annoyance
stopping
his
story
in
mid
sentence
I
say
my
good
man
Whatever
ARE
you
doing
Ernie
looked
up
disconcertedly
I
um
it
The
bell
continued
to
bong
loudly
How
RUDE
Sterno
glared
at
Ernie
Ernie
examined
the
bell
frantically
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
turn
it
off
He
could
see
now
that
is
wasn
t
a
real
bell
but
rather
an
electronic
synthesized
bell
with
orchestral
sounds
a
rhythm
machine
and
full
MIDI
capability
Ernie
pushed
the
tiny
buttons
frenziedly
desperately
trying
to
turn
the
thing
off
The
sound
changed
Chick
a
Boom
Chick
a
BOOM
Ernie
had
accidentally
turned
on
the
rhythm
machine
The
door
to
the
study
opened
The
Butler
entered
a
swarthy
character
who
looked
somehow
familiar
to
Ernie
The
sound
abruptly
stopped
Ernie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
The
Butler
looked
at
Ernie
and
then
at
Lord
Foofaraw
Chu
rang
he
enquired
Ah
yes
Lord
Foofaraw
seemed
to
have
regained
his
composure
More
tea
Richard
Chure
the
Butler
said
agreeably
and
began
refilling
their
cups
His
Lordship
resumed
his
story
and
there
I
was
surrounded
by
techno
savages
They
had
decided
to
sacrifice
a
virgin
but
the
first
one
they
selected
was
discovered
to
be
how
shall
I
say
damaged
so
they
were
obliged
to
move
on
to
the
next
who
became
Virgin
But
she
was
found
to
be
not
entirely
suitable
so
they
settled
upon
Virgin
revised
It
seemed
to
have
gotten
dark
outside
although
they
had
hardly
noticed
it
since
the
Butler
or
someone
had
turned
on
the
lights
That
was
odd
Ernie
thought
because
it
had
been
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
only
a
few
minutes
ago
He
was
going
to
consider
it
further
when
abruptly
the
lights
went
out
plunging
them
all
into
total
darkness
From
out
of
nowhere
a
gust
of
wind
blew
up
throwing
the
French
doors
open
violently
Suddenly
a
shot
rang
out
They
heard
a
cry
and
a
body
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
The
lights
came
on
again
There
in
the
middle
of
the
Persian
carpet
Lord
Foofaraw
lay
dead
in
a
pool
of
blood
Nearby
lay
a
smoking
gun
Ernie
was
stunned
Before
he
could
even
think
of
what
to
do
the
oak
doors
leading
to
the
rest
of
the
house
flew
open
and
a
man
in
a
trench
coat
and
a
fedora
strode
purposefully
in
Scotland
Yard
he
announced
No
one
leave
this
room
A
crowd
of
Bobbies
seemed
to
have
materialized
outside
of
both
sets
of
doors
Clearly
no
one
was
going
to
be
able
to
leave
this
room
until
the
detective
was
ready
to
allow
it
Ernie
frowned
This
was
beginning
to
remind
him
an
awful
lot
of
some
movie
or
other
although
he
still
couldn
t
remember
which
one
it
was
Oh
I
remember
this
Captain
Memory
exclaimed
delightedly
This
is
a
game
called
MYSTERY
you
know
one
of
those
who
dunnit
things
We
have
to
solve
the
mystery
The
captain
seemed
very
pleased
This
is
great
fun
The
detective
scanned
all
of
their
faces
carefully
So
here
we
all
are
at
last
he
said
At
last
Ernie
thought
Uh
we
only
just
got
here
Ernie
said
tentatively
wiping
his
greasy
hands
on
his
fur
loincloth
And
we
really
don
t
know
anything
about
this
so
if
you
don
t
mind
we
ll
just
be
on
our
He
started
to
get
up
Sit
DOWN
shouted
the
detective
No
one
leaves
until
I
say
so
Ernie
sat
He
hadn
t
really
thought
he
was
going
to
get
away
with
that
but
he
d
though
he
d
give
it
a
try
anyway
So
the
detective
continued
We
know
you
all
had
a
reason
for
wanting
Lord
Foofaraw
dead
The
foursome
all
looked
at
one
another
Ernie
shrugged
Captain
Memory
shrugged
The
Fly
shrugged
Sterno
shrugged
in
a
very
un
doglike
manner
Well
actually
Ernie
began
tentatively
No
I
A
likely
story
interrupted
the
detective
Here
you
are
wearing
a
fur
loincloth
and
a
plastic
broadsword
carrying
He
cocked
an
eye
quizzically
at
Ernie
a
coffee
maker
And
you
expect
me
to
believe
a
story
like
that
And
just
WHERE
did
you
get
that
bag
of
gold
anyway
Ernie
began
to
feel
very
self
conscious
He
decided
that
perhaps
he
had
better
keep
his
mouth
shut
It
didn
t
seem
to
him
that
saying
Attila
the
Hun
gave
it
to
me
would
go
over
very
well
And
what
about
those
LAMB
CHOPS
the
detective
thundered
Everyone
knows
that
one
never
serves
lamb
chops
for
tea
So
just
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
Ernie
shrank
down
into
his
seat
And
YOU
The
detective
jabbed
a
finger
at
the
Fly
who
flinched
You
blamed
Lord
Foofaraw
for
your
terrible
accident
didn
t
you
The
accident
that
left
you
horribly
disfigured
and
left
Lord
Foofaraw
free
to
start
an
affair
with
YOUR
WIFE
But
but
I
don
t
even
have
a
wife
The
Fly
began
his
antennae
waving
in
consternation
All
these
years
you
ve
plotted
revenge
haven
t
you
the
detective
continued
And
now
suddenly
mysteriously
Lord
Foofaraw
turns
up
DEAD
What
are
we
to
make
of
THAT
my
fine
Fly
friend
But
but
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
wildly
The
detective
however
had
already
gone
on
to
the
next
suspect
And
YOU
He
jabbed
a
finger
at
Sterno
You
ve
had
no
reward
for
years
of
faithful
service
have
you
You
ve
worked
like
a
dog
running
and
fetching
every
time
his
Lordship
snapped
his
fingers
We
know
how
you
resented
it
how
you
longed
to
even
the
score
Yet
year
after
year
you
let
his
Lordship
treat
you
like
an
animal
with
never
a
whimper
of
complaint
And
NOW
here
you
are
helping
yourself
to
his
Lordship
s
best
brandy
and
cigars
What
would
his
Lordship
have
thought
of
THAT
Sterno
thought
fast
Woof
he
answered
The
detective
however
had
already
gone
on
to
the
next
suspect
And
finally
the
detective
said
leaving
a
pregnant
pause
we
have
YOU
He
jabbed
a
finger
in
Captain
Memory
s
face
The
famous
Captain
Memory
Through
Space
and
Time
Without
a
Dime
I
think
you
ve
been
heard
to
say
Actually
I
sort
of
prefer
Through
Time
and
Space
to
a
Better
Place
answered
the
Captain
conversationally
A
likely
story
snapped
the
detective
We
know
what
you
ve
been
up
to
We
see
you
when
you
re
sleeping
We
know
if
you
re
awake
We
know
if
you
ve
been
bad
or
good
so
be
He
stopped
abruptly
glancing
suspiciously
about
him
Never
mind
The
question
here
is
just
exactly
how
do
you
JUMP
out
of
sectors
that
aren
t
supposed
to
accept
any
external
commands
anyway
Captain
Memory
frowned
What
does
that
have
to
do
with
Lord
Foofaraw
You
know
very
well
what
it
has
to
do
with
the
case
snapped
the
detective
Just
answer
the
question
Suddenly
a
light
went
on
in
Ernie
s
head
He
suddenly
remembered
how
all
the
pieces
fit
together
I
know
he
shouted
The
BUTLER
DID
IT
The
butler
blanched
Hey
mon
he
cried
out
What
chu
talkin
about
I
don
do
nothin
The
detective
looked
irritated
Don
t
change
the
subject
he
snapped
He
turned
back
to
Captain
Memory
Awright
youse
guys
Talk
Youse
guys
ain
t
gonna
play
me
for
a
patsy
Ernie
and
the
Fly
looked
at
each
other
in
confusion
The
detective
continued
You
lousy
two
bit
gunsels
think
you
can
take
a
rod
and
One
of
the
Bobbies
came
in
hurriedly
tapped
the
detective
on
the
shoulder
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
What
the
detective
snapped
He
laughed
nervously
Oh
Right
BRITISH
detective
He
laughed
again
Pip
pip
Cheerio
Eh
wot
Ernie
frowned
There
was
something
very
suspicious
about
this
detective
For
one
thing
his
large
British
style
handlebar
mustache
did
not
seem
to
be
attached
to
his
face
very
well
It
was
slowly
drooping
off
one
side
of
his
face
There
was
something
funny
about
his
clothes
too
The
trenchcoat
was
okay
the
hat
was
okay
Maybe
it
was
the
jackboots
Sterno
gave
the
detective
a
pitiless
glare
You
lost
your
character
he
accused
The
detective
laughed
nervously
Character
Vot
character
I
m
not
a
character
I
m
uh
He
looked
flustered
He
elbowed
the
bobby
next
to
him
Quick
he
whispered
Who
am
I
The
bobby
whispered
something
in
his
ear
The
detective
seemed
to
recover
his
composure
somewhat
Oh
yes
Of
course
I
m
the
famous
British
detective
Thomas
Cheddar
Sterno
s
fur
stood
on
end
Oh
no
It
s
cheese
CHEESE
RUN
he
wailed
But
it
was
too
late
The
detective
whipped
an
evil
looking
weapon
out
from
under
his
raincoat
which
parted
to
reveal
a
black
SS
uniform
beneath
it
Enough
of
zis
shtupidity
he
cried
holding
the
foursome
at
bay
You
vill
perhaps
recognize
me
now
he
said
confidently
He
screwed
a
monocle
into
one
eye
and
whipped
off
the
false
handlebar
mustache
with
a
flourish
He
immediately
regretted
this
and
winced
with
pain
as
the
glue
on
the
false
mustache
tore
out
half
the
hairs
of
his
real
mustache
He
quickly
regained
his
composure
however
and
waited
for
some
response
from
the
foursome
Captain
Memory
looked
at
Ernie
Ernie
shrugged
The
detective
looked
from
one
to
the
other
You
DO
recognize
me
ja
he
asked
a
bit
uncertainly
I
m
sure
we
ve
seen
you
someplace
before
said
Sterno
patronizingly
Of
course
agreed
Captain
Memory
It
s
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
It
s
uh
He
trailed
off
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
uncertainly
Suddenly
he
brightened
Oh
I
get
it
It
s
a
game
right
First
syllable
Sounds
like
He
began
gesticulating
wildly
I
know
I
know
It
s
Fred
Astaire
right
Fred
Astaire
Enough
the
detective
shouted
angrily
I
cannot
believe
dat
you
do
not
recognize
me

Sterno
continued
It

Von

Captain

agreeably
Why

Nein

shrieked
I

The

sulked
Why
do

always
get
to
ask
the
questions
How
come
we
never
get
to
ask
any
questions
Quite
right
Sterno
asserted
And
why
must
you
always
wear
that
dreadful
uniform
Von
Liederkranz
stopped
startled
Uniform
Vot

wrong

my

I

Sterno
sniffed
It

hardly
the
thing
for
High

I
should

Puttink

asked
incredulously
White

Sterno
went
on
Puttink

The
Nazi
seemed
amazed
PUTTING

The
Fly
shouted
joyously
finishing
the
line
of
the
song
I
knew
it
I
knew
it
was
Fred

Von
Liederkranz
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
Ja
I
DO
look
a
great
deal
like
your
Fred
Astaire
nein
Of
course
he
didn
t
look
anything
like
Fred
Astaire
but
no
one
wanted
to
be
the
one
to
tell
him
that
Oh
yes
Sterno
enthused
insincerely
You
ve
all
the
elegance
all
the
grace
of
the
greatest
dancer
of
all
time
Von
Liederkranz
preened
Ja
dat
s
right
I
do
Looking
down
he
noticed
Lord
Foofaraw
s
top
hat
which
had
rolled
off
his
head
when
he
collapsed
dead
He
picked
it
up
tossing
his
own
military
cap
aside
Using
Lord
Foofaraw
s
top
hat
and
his
own
riding
crop
as
a
cane
he
attempted
to
do
a
Fred
Astaire
style
top
hat
and
cane
number
He
began
to
do
a
few
awkward
shuffling
dance
steps
Puttink
on
mein
top
hat
he
began
to
sing
The
Bobbies
had
by
now
shed
their
English
policeman
uniforms
to
reveal
their
Nazi
uniforms
beneath
They
were
totally
confused
by
this
turn
of
events
They
shuffled
about
awkwardly
not
knowing
what
to
do
Von
Liederkranz
glared
at
them
Sing
he
commanded
The
Nazi
s
lined
up
and
formed
a
chorus
line
swaying
with
the
music
singing
off
key
puttink
on
mein
white
tie
Von
Liederkranz
attempted
to
do
some
slightly
more
complicated
steps
but
succeeded
only
in
knocking
over
the
silver
tray
sending
the
tea
cups
and
little
plastic
sandwiches
crashing
to
the
ground
This
threw
the
other
Nazi
s
off
their
rhythm
Half
of
them
swayed
left
and
half
swayed
right
causing
them
to
violently
bump
into
each
other
knocking
some
off
their
feet
Their
voices
trailed
off
Sing
von
Liederkranz
commanded
ferociously
The
Nazi
s
resumed
singing
with
feigned
enthusiasm
PUTTINK
ON
DER
RITZ
I
knew
it
the
Fly
enthused
I
knew
it
was
Fred
Astaire
That
means
I
win
right
Von
Liederkranz
and
the
Nazis
began
dancing
gracelessly
towards
the
door
that
led
to
the
hallway
singing
Dum
de
dum
de
dum
dum
since
they
couldn
t
remember
the
rest
of
the
words
Bravo
Sterno
applauded
enthusiastically
Keep
it
up
you
re
doing
great
Von
Liederkranz
grinned
broadly
and
began
dancing
with
greater
enthusiasm
although
no
better
rhythm
He
headed
out
the
door
and
down
the
hall
the
Nazi
chorus
line
crowding
awkwardly
behind
him
Fabulous
Sterno
enthused
He
signalled
to
Ernie
the
Fly
and
Captain
Memory
who
caught
the
hint
and
began
applauding
as
well
Wonderful
Tremendous
they
all
cheered
The
Nazi
s
voices
began
receding
down
the
hall
Sterno
gestured
towards
the
French
doors
leading
to
the
outside
The
four
got
up
and
began
tiptoeing
towards
them
Suddenly
the
heard
a
resounding
crash
coming
from
down
the
hall
Dummkopf
Schweinhund
cried
a
voice
followed
by
the
snap
of
a
riding
crop
RUN
cried
Sterno
The
foursome
charged
through
the
French
doors
and
went
sprinting
across
the
field
behind
the
house
In
a
few
moments
the
English
Tudor
mansion
was
out
of
view
Peculiarly
enough
as
soon
as
they
left
the
mansion
it
was
mid
afternoon
again
The
darkness
seemed
to
have
been
confined
to
the
study
The
four
slowed
down
to
a
walk
exhausted
and
out
of
breath
Ernie
looked
back
There
was
no
sign
of
pursuit
Looks
like
they
re
still
trying
to
get
their
act
together
Captain
Memory
commented
That
act
has
got
let
s
say
a
few
rough
spots
that
need
to
be
ironed
out
Sterno
snickered
I
think
they
re
going
to
be
working
on
it
for
rather
a
long
time
Ernie
sighed
with
relief
Those
Nazis
made
him
very
uneasy
The
four
continued
walking
They
were
in
the
midst
of
what
seemed
to
be
many
acres
of
lush
grassy
meadow
A
short
distance
ahead
Ernie
spotted
flock
of
sheep
peacefully
grazing
Sheep
Ernie
exclaimed
Really
Sterno
asked
sarcastically
How
clever
of
you
to
figure
that
out
A
small
group
of
sheep
detached
themselves
from
the
flock
and
walked
up
to
the
foursome
Ernie
noticed
that
they
looked
much
like
the
other
sheep
in
the
flock
except
for
the
fact
that
they
were
wearing
dark
sunglasses
Looking
closely
he
could
see
that
some
of
them
seemed
to
be
carrying
some
objects
that
looked
a
lot
like
hmm
well
like
surfboards
Baa
the
first
sheep
said
as
if
in
greeting
Baa
Baa
Sterno
replied
The
sheep
seemed
to
respond
favorably
to
this
You
speak
their
language
Ernie
was
astounded
Of
course
Sterno
replied
offhandedly
I
was
always
a
great
student
of
foreign
languages
But
what
language
do
they
speak
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Sheepish
of
course
Sterno
replied
in
a
patronizing
tone
Everybody
knows
THAT
The
lead
sheep
continued
Baa
Baa
Baa
Ba
inquired
Sterno
Baa
Baa
Baa
the
lead
sheep
repeated
vigorously
A
second
later
the
next
sheep
repeated
the
same
thing
Baa
Baa
Baa
And
then
the
next
sheep
picked
up
the
refrain
soon
they
were
all
chanting
Baa
Baa
Baa
Suddenly
the
lead
sheep
launched
into
the
main
verse
Baa
Baa
Baa
Baa
Barbara
Ann
Oh
it
s
the
Beach
Sheep
the
Fly
exclaimed
By
now
the
entire
group
of
sheep
had
launched
into
the
song
in
full
chorus
They
re
not
bad
admitted
Ernie
Even
the
President
likes
the
Beach
Sheep
the
Fly
asserted
Of
course
they
re
not
really
the
Beach
Sheep
Sterno
explained
They
re
not
the
Fly
seemed
very
disappointed
Don
t
be
silly
Sterno
sniggered
You
couldn
t
expect
the
real
Beach
Sheep
to
be
performing
in
a
little
out
of
the
way
meadow
like
this
could
you
The
only
play
the
really
big
fields
nowadays
Aww
The
Fly
s
antennae
drooped
No
continued
Sterno
They
re
just
one
of
a
whole
flock
of
Beach
Sheep
impersonators
A
good
imitation
but
not
the
real
thing
Ernie
thought
a
moment
You
mean
like
Elvis
impersonators
The
Sheepish
equivalent
Sterno
agreed
Having
finished
their
song
the
Beach
Sheep
began
discussing
something
with
Sterno
in
very
serious
tones
Ernie
of
course
couldn
t
understand
a
bleat
of
it
since
it
was
all
in
Sheepish
So
what
s
the
deal
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
It
seems
the
sheep
have
a
problem
Sterno
explained
They
re
being
oppressed
by
one
of
their
own
kind
a
cruel
tyrant
who
will
stop
at
nothing
to
get
his
own
way
Gee
that
s
tough
the
Fly
shook
his
head
sadly
What
s
this
tyrant
called
anyway
Ernie
was
curious
Sterno
paused
dramatically
They
call
him
the
Wooly
Bully
Ernie
frowned
That
name
seemed
somehow
familiar
to
him
The
Fly
started
snapping
his
fingers
and
humming
Wooly
bully
wooly
bully
Will
you
STOP
that
barked
Sterno
Have
some
respect
please
This
is
a
serious
problem
Oh
Sorry
The
Fly
fell
silent
Sterno
continued
conversing
with
