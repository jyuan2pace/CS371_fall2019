wasn
t
sure
this
was
going
to
be
such
a
good
idea
Aw
come
on
guys
the
Fly
enthused
It
ll
be
fun
Well
Ernie
was
unconvinced
Do
you
have
something
better
to
do
Sterno
demanded
Well
Ernie
hesitated
That
s
settled
then
Sterno
stated
with
finality
He
glared
at
Ernie
And
I
DO
wish
you
wouldn
t
keep
repeating
yourself
all
the
time
Well
Ernie
began
PLEASE
Sterno
cut
him
off
Ernie
decided
to
just
be
quiet
The
foursome
trudged
through
the
dry
sand
Luckily
the
sun
though
bright
was
not
very
hot
Ernie
hoped
they
didn
t
have
far
to
go
Trying
to
walk
through
the
shifting
blowing
sand
was
very
tiring
The
approached
the
sign
The
sign
seemed
to
be
pointing
to
something
behind
one
of
the
Pyramids
As
they
rounded
the
corner
they
became
able
to
see
what
it
was
Wow
breathed
Ernie
in
awe
A
fabulous
Egyptian
temple
stood
in
front
of
them
Crumbling
columns
towered
feet
into
the
sky
supporting
a
sandstone
roof
that
had
collapsed
at
various
points
In
the
center
of
the
temple
stood
a
large
stone
structure
with
no
windows
and
only
one
door
which
was
closed
After
a
few
moments
Ernie
noticed
that
there
was
a
small
brightly
colored
wooden
building
standing
in
front
of
the
temple
A
sign
on
the
little
building
said
SEE
THE
ANCIENT
UNDISCOVERED
TOMB
Admission
Inside
the
small
building
was
a
portly
middle
aged
man
wearing
a
bright
plaid
suit
and
a
straw
hat
and
smoking
a
cigar
Step
right
up
gentlemen
he
cried
to
them
Yer
just
in
time
Oh
wow
said
the
Fly
obviously
excited
We
wanna
see
the
tomb
Of
course
you
do
sonny
said
the
man
flicking
the
ash
of
his
cigar
Everybody
wants
to
see
the
tomb
Let
s
see
there
s
four
at
two
dollars
each
He
looked
the
group
over
I
ll
tell
you
what
I
m
gonna
do
Because
I
like
yer
uh
He
looked
at
the
Fly
with
puzzlement
face
I
m
gonna
give
you
a
special
price
Only
for
all
of
ya
Gee
thanks
said
the
Fly
enthusiastically
Ernie
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
Hey
that
s
okay
guys
the
Fly
cut
him
off
It
s
on
me
He
handed
the
ticket
seller
a
bill
Step
right
on
in
gentlemen
The
ticket
seller
gestured
towards
the
door
of
the
tomb
As
they
approached
Ernie
examined
the
hieroglyphics
on
the
walls
of
the
temple
Suddenly
one
caught
his
eye
Look
He
pointed
it
out
It
s
the
RCA
dog
And
the
phonograph
This
must
be
Oh
your
not
going
to
start
that
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
business
again
are
you
Sterno
said
irritatedly
Well
Ernie
began
Will
you
PLEASE
stop
saying
that
Sterno
cried
in
exasperation
Ernie
shut
up
The
interior
of
the
building
did
in
fact
look
like
an
ancient
undiscovered
tomb
Mummy
cases
lined
the
walls
Strange
carved
containers
some
shaped
like
animals
lay
on
all
sides
Drifting
sand
lay
piled
up
against
everything
Wow
The
Fly
was
amazed
An
ancient
undiscovered
tomb
I
bet
we
re
the
first
people
to
be
in
here
in
a
zillion
years
An
ancient
wooden
cabinet
caught
Ernie
s
attention
The
figure
of
the
RCA
dog
was
carved
into
it
Ernie
opened
it
gingerly
Aha
he
cried
Look
Inside
sure
enough
was
an
ancient
acoustic
Victrola
type
record
player
Lined
up
neatly
in
slots
were
dozens
of
flat
black
disks
that
could
only
be
rpm
records
See
proclaimed
Ernie
I
told
you
so
It
s
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Cool
enthused
the
Fly
Play
it
Ernie
was
taken
aback
This
could
be
the
greatest
find
of
all
time
It
could
change
the
world
completely
alter
Life
As
We
Know
It
He
had
to
be
very
careful
One
mistake
might
ruin
the
whole
thing
If
he
made
the
wrong
move
the
greatest
discovery
in
history
might
be
lost
forever
and
it
would
be
all
his
fault
Um
play
it
Ernie
hesitated
uncomfortably
Um
I
m
not
sure
Play
it
demanded
Sterno
irritably
You
ve
been
going
on
and
on
about
this
for
for
Sterno
thought
a
moment
Actually
for
BILLIONS
of
years
now
and
we
re
all
just
about
sick
of
it
All
right
here
it
is
Now
play
it
already
Ernie
looked
over
the
machine
warily
Um
I
m
not
exactly
sure
how
to
work
it
He
tugged
at
one
of
the
rpm
records
It
refused
to
come
out
of
it
s
slot
Sterno
sighed
in
exasperation
It
s
simple
enough
Look
He
pointed
to
a
corroded
metal
strip
on
the
bottom
part
of
the
machine
There
were
a
number
of
buttons
on
it
and
a
slot
Next
to
the
slot
Ernie
could
just
barely
make
out
the
words
Insert
Coin
Ernie
searched
through
his
pockets
Um
Oh
all
right
Sterno
snapped
annoyedly
Here
He
handed
Ernie
the
Cadillac
penny
Um
thanks
Ernie
dropped
the
coin
into
the
slot
For
a
moment
nothing
happened
Then
slowly
the
ancient
machine
began
to
creak
into
action
A
small
dim
light
appeared
behind
a
little
square
next
to
the
slot
Brushing
away
the
dust
Ernie
could
just
barely
make
out
the
words
Make
Selection
Oh
wow
said
Ernie
Next
to
each
button
was
a
small
rectangle
which
was
obviously
supposed
to
contain
the
name
of
the
song
Unfortunately
most
of
them
were
so
covered
by
dirt
and
corrosion
that
Ernie
couldn
t
read
them
Um
which
one
should
I
pick
he
asked
in
confusion
Who
cares
barked
Sterno
in
exasperation
Just
pick
SOMETHING
Ernie
peered
at
the
selections
He
was
desperately
afraid
of
making
the
wrong
choice
This
might
be
his
only
chance
to
learn
the
Secret
of
the
Universe
or
something
like
that
He
had
to
make
the
right
selection
Suddenly
he
saw
something
he
recognized
Hey
look
at
this
He
pointed
at
one
of
the
selections
It
s
Sam
the
Sham
and
the
PHARAOHS
See
I
told
you
Play
it
Cried
the
Fly
enthusiastically
Play
it
snapped
Sterno
annoyedly
But
but
Ernie
peered
at
it
more
closely
The
song
is
Walk
Like
a
Man
I
don
t
think
Sam
the
Sham
ever
did
that
song
PLAY
IT
shrieked
Sterno
his
patience
gone
Ernie
frowned
He
looked
at
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
just
shrugged
Well
Ernie
said
hesitantly
okay
He
pushed
the
button
The
ancient
machine
slowly
creaked
into
action
A
rpm
record
dropped
on
to
the
platter
and
the
device
began
to
play
Within
the
first
few
notes
Ernie
knew
something
had
gone
terribly
wrong
The
music
was
growing
louder
with
every
second
much
louder
than
an
old
Victrola
could
ever
have
made
it
in
fact
painfully
loud
This
isn
t
Walk
Like
A
Man
Ernie
cried
A
terrible
realization
hit
him
If
you
took
Walk
Like
A
Man
and
crossed
it
with
Sam
the
Sham
and
the
Pharaohs
you
d
get
Suddenly
it
was
all
too
clear
He
recognized
the
music
plainly
now
Oh
no
Ernie
wailed
It
s
Walk
Like
an
Egyptian
What
yelled
Captain
Memory
The
music
was
too
loud
drowning
out
their
words
He
looked
at
the
others
He
could
see
their
mouths
moving
but
he
couldn
t
hear
a
word
they
were
saying
The
music
was
too
loud
drowning
out
everything
The
music
grew
louder
with
every
passing
second
The
pain
began
to
build
in
Ernie
s
head
He
tried
to
cover
his
ears
with
his
hands
but
found
it
very
difficult
to
do
while
holding
the
coffee
maker
It
didn
t
help
anyway
The
music
was
so
loud
that
it
vibrated
through
his
hand
through
his
head
The
whole
temple
was
vibrating
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
Do
something
he
shouted
The
Captain
shrugged
and
pointed
to
his
ears
obviously
meaning
I
can
t
hear
a
word
you
re
saying
Ernie
looked
at
Sterno
and
the
Fly
They
had
their
hands
over
their
ears
their
eyes
clenched
tight
in
pain
Sterno
especially
seemed
to
be
suffering
his
keen
dog
hearing
more
affected
by
the
sound
than
the
others
Ernie
was
miserable
Not
only
was
he
in
pain
from
the
terribly
loud
music
but
his
very
best
idea
ever
to
go
find
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
had
turned
into
a
disaster
The
music
grew
ever
louder
Ernie
knew
that
excessive
sound
levels
can
be
fatal
They
were
all
going
to
be
killed
by
Walk
Like
an
Egyptian
played
at
a
million
decibels
and
he
didn
t
even
like
that
song
Ernie
tried
to
hold
his
hands
more
tightly
over
his
ears
If
only
the
coffee
maker
wasn
t
in
his
way
Suddenly
it
hit
him
The
coffee
maker
He
set
the
selector
to
Destroy
aimed
it
at
the
ancient
Victrola
and
flipped
the
strength
lever
to
Full
Suddenly
the
Victrola
vanished
along
with
the
cabinet
the
wall
of
the
tomb
half
the
temple
and
just
about
everything
else
Ernie
could
see
In
fact
Ernie
now
seemed
to
be
standing
at
the
edge
of
a
huge
chasm
It
was
so
broad
that
Ernie
couldn
t
see
the
other
side
so
deep
that
he
couldn
t
see
the
bottom
Ernie
felt
a
tap
on
his
shoulder
He
turned
The
Fly
was
pointing
at
the
opposite
wall
of
the
tomb
and
saying
something
but
Ernie
couldn
t
make
out
what
Although
the
music
had
stopped
when
the
Victrola
was
destroyed
Ernie
s
ears
were
still
ringing
so
badly
that
he
couldn
t
hear
a
thing
Looking
at
the
wall
Ernie
guessed
what
the
problem
was
Without
the
other
side
of
the
tomb
to
hold
it
up
the
huge
stone
wall
was
swaying
It
looked
as
though
it
might
crush
them
at
any
moment
Without
thinking
Ernie
aimed
the
coffee
maker
at
the
wall
and
flipped
on
the
power
switch
This
time
his
ears
were
just
barely
recovered
enough
to
hear
the
tremendous
roar
as
the
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
destroyed
the
other
wall
and
everything
else
for
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
As
the
dust
cleared
Ernie
could
see
that
where
the
opposite
wall
had
been
there
was
now
what
seemed
to
be
a
bottomless
measureless
chasm
On
that
side
too
there
was
a
steep
drop
as
though
they
were
standing
on
the
edge
of
an
infinitely
tall
cliff
All
that
remained
was
the
foot
by
foot
patch
of
sand
and
rock
which
had
been
the
inside
of
the
tomb
where
they
now
stood
Looking
around
all
that
Ernie
could
see
was
the
little
piece
of
land
that
they
were
now
standing
on
and
the
sky
Everything
else
appeared
to
have
been
disintegrated
As
the
ringing
in
Ernie
s
ears
slowly
subsided
he
began
to
hear
Captain
Memory
saying
something
Wow
The
Captain
was
peeking
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
That
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
sure
is
powerful
Ernie
carefully
peered
over
the
brink
He
tried
to
see
the
bottom
of
the
crater
but
he
couldn
t
see
a
thing
No
wait
a
minute
He
did
see
something
he
saw
stars
How
could
there
be
stars
at
the
bottom
of
a
hole
The
Fly
peeked
over
the
edge
as
well
Whew
That
s
some
big
hole
you
blew
there
buddy
Ernie
continued
to
peer
into
the
hole
trying
to
make
some
sense
out
of
what
he
saw
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Um
how
far
down
does
that
hole
go
anyway
The
Captain
shook
his
head
sadly
All
the
way
Huh
Ernie
was
uncomprehending
All
the
way
to
where
China
Captain
Memory
continued
to
peer
downward
Further
than
that
From
the
look
of
it
I
d
say
just
about
all
the
way
to
Mars
The
Captain
shook
his
head
sadly
You
know
you
really
should
read
the
directions
to
those
things
before
you
use
them
Ernie
looked
at
the
coffee
maker
in
dismay
He
placed
the
it
carefully
in
the
sand
and
gingerly
edged
away
from
it
Hey
this
is
really
cool
the
Fly
continued
to
look
over
the
rim
I
can
see
stars
looking
down
he
looked
up
AND
looking
up
He
peered
over
the
opposite
edge
Hey
there
s
stars
on
all
sides
Neat
How
did
you
do
that
Sterno
stared
at
Ernie
his
eyes
widening
in
horror
You
didn
t
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
He
did
What
demanded
Ernie
What
did
I
do
Sterno
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
shock
You
mean
that
one
little
device
could
Captain
Memory
nodded
dismally
I
m
afraid
so
WHAT
Ernie
was
becoming
very
agitated
Sterno
glared
balefully
at
Ernie
How
could
you
DO
such
a
thing
Will
somebody
please
tell
me
what
I
did
Ernie
wailed
Captain
Memory
sighed
Well
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
You
see
this
little
patch
of
ground
we
re
standing
on
That
s
all
that
s
left
All
that
s
left
of
what
Ernie
wasn
t
following
this
at
all
Of
the
planet
Earth
the
Captain
declared
morosely
WHAT
Ernie
was
horrified
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
dejectedly
I
m
afraid
you
blew
just
about
the
entire
planet
away
Everything
except
the
little
patch
we
re
standing
on
He
peeked
over
the
edge
Looks
like
you
nailed
the
moon
too
But
But
Ernie
protested
weakly
How
could
that
HAPPEN
The
Captain
sighed
I
told
you
that
thing
was
powerful
He
continued
peering
over
the
edge
Something
caught
his
eye
He
brightened
Ah
good
That
s
a
relief
What
Ernie
was
desperate
for
any
good
news
Captain
Memory
smiled
You
ll
be
glad
to
know
that
Mars
is
fine
The
blast
didn
t
even
touch
it
He
peered
more
closely
It
might
be
a
little
off
it
s
orbit
but
aside
from
that
it
s
perfectly
okay
Ernie
moaned
Suddenly
Captain
Memory
straightened
up
He
began
looking
in
all
directions
a
look
of
consternation
on
his
face
Something
s
happening
Sterno
glared
at
Ernie
This
is
all
your
fault
The
Fly
put
his
hands
up
to
his
head
Oh
wow
My
head
It
s
What
s
happening
to
me
Ernie
s
jaw
dropped
in
amazement
The
Fly
s
head
was
beginning
to
change
As
the
others
watched
in
astonishment
the
Fly
s
head
shimmered
disappeared
and
was
replaced
by
the
perfectly
normal
looking
head
of
a
man
in
his
mid
s
Whoo
complained
the
Fly
I
feel
really
weird
He
squinted
There
s
something
wrong
with
my
eyes
I
can
t
see
too
good
anymore
You
re
you
re
normal
Ernie
gasped
in
astonishment
The
Fly
put
his
hands
up
to
his
head
feeling
out
it
s
shape
Oh
wow
It
s
my
old
head
I
got
it
back
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
is
helpless
astonishment
What
s
happening
Captain
Memory
too
looked
amazed
It
s
the
game
We
ve
ended
the
game
Of
course
Sterno
caught
his
drift
immediately
By
destroying
most
of
the
world
you
ve
brought
the
game
to
an
end
There
s
not
enough
of
the
planet
left
to
play
with
Right
Captain
Memory
beamed
And
you
ve
done
it
within
the
logical
confines
of
the
program
Using
materials
found
within
the
program
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
program
s
logic
Captain
Memory
reached
out
to
shake
Ernie
s
hand
Good
job
Sterno
looked
ruefully
over
the
edge
of
the
chasm
Of
course
I
don
t
think
we
got
very
many
points
It
doesn
t
matter
said
Captain
Memory
cheerfully
It
s
Game
Over
That
s
all
we
need
Ernie
was
finding
this
all
difficult
to
follow
So
now
what
Now
the
system
shuts
down
in
an
orderly
manner
and
we
re
all
free
cried
the
Captain
jubilantly
The
evil
genius
Waldo
Stadium
is
thwarted
his
Cyberslaves
are
set
free
We
win
Ernie
s
eyes
narrowed
You
talk
about
all
of
this
almost
as
if
it
was
a
game
Captain
Memory
seemed
taken
aback
Did
I
he
said
innocently
Well
I
m
sure
I
didn
t
mean
to
He
trailed
off
Meanwhile
the
Fly
was
engrossed
in
examining
his
head
He
had
pulled
out
a
small
pocket
mirror
and
was
looking
himself
over
carefully
Hey
this
is
great
he
enthused
I
ve
got
my
looks
back
The
babes
are
gonna
love
it
Awright
It
s
time
to
PA
A
A
RTY
Ernie
looked
around
thoughtfully
There
wasn
t
much
to
see
All
that
was
left
of
the
planet
Earth
was
the
little
patch
of
ground
that
they
stood
on
What
s
what
s
going
to
happen
to
us
now
Well
Captain
Memory
scratched
his
head
I
guess
we
ll
all
be
going
home
Sterno
put
a
paw
over
his
stomach
I
I
feel
very
strange
he
complained
I
Suddenly
Sterno
shimmered
and
disappeared
Ernie
was
aghast
Oh
my
god
he
s
gone
What
happened
to
him
It
s
beginning
Captain
Memory
replied
calmly
We
re
all
going
back
to
our
proper
place
and
time
the
Captain
hesitated
wherever
that
is
We
re
going
back
the
Fly
was
enthusiastic
AWRIGHT
He
too
had
begun
to
shimmer
He
flashed
Ernie
the
thumbs
up
sign
It
s
PARTY
TIME
With
that
he
was
gone
Now
there
was
only
Ernie
and
Captain
Memory
But
but
what
should
I
do
when
I
get
back
Ernie
wanted
to
know
I
mean
after
all
this
shouldn
t
I
I
dunno
DO
something
Captain
Memory
shrugged
I
guess
you
ll
just
have
to
wait
and
see
Suddenly
Ernie
felt
ill
The
world
began
to
shimmer
around
him
The
Captain
s
shape
was
becoming
vague
and
indistinct
The
last
thing
Ernie
saw
was
the
Captain
gazing
ruefully
at
his
bare
wrist
I
sure
wish
I
could
have
gotten
a
watch
though
he
said
sadly
With
that
the
scene
vanished
EPILOGUE
Ernie
s
head
swan
The
strange
distorted
shapes
of
a
surreal
landscape
swirled
around
him
He
stumbled
backwards
and
his
hand
fell
upon
a
doorknob
Reflexively
he
pulled
it
open
and
stepped
through
A
bright
fluorescent
light
dazzled
his
eyes
He
became
aware
of
the
sound
of
many
voices
in
the
distance
He
staggered
forward
All
done
A
girl
s
voice
startled
Ernie
He
looked
up
He
was
back
at
the
Arcade
Did
you
have
a
nice
game
the
girl
at
the
information
booth
was
asking
him
twirling
a
finger
through
her
hair
absent
mindedly
Uh
Ernie
could
only
mumble
HowEVER
did
you
get
that
loincloth
so
dirty
she
reproved
cracking
her
chewing
gum
loudly
There
s
a
five
dollar
cleaning
fee
for
that
you
know
Ernie
s
mind
was
slowly
clearing
Uh
yeah
he
managed
to
answer
You
can
change
in
there
the
girl
pointed
to
a
dressing
room
When
you
return
the
loincloth
and
the
broadsword
you
ll
get
your
deposit
back
she
looked
at
him
pointedly
Minus
the
five
dollar
cleaning
fee
As
Ernie
changed
his
mind
began
to
clear
Putting
his
own
clothes
on
again
made
him
feel
almost
normal
Had
all
of
this
really
happened
or
had
it
all
been
just
an
illusion
Maybe
it
was
all
just
a
malfunctioning
computer
program
Ernie
couldn
t
be
sure
Ernie
walked
slowly
home
from
the
Arcade
trying
to
put
his
mind
in
order
He
looked
carefully
at
everything
he
passed
For
some
reason
it
seemed
to
him
that
things
would
be
somehow
different
Yet
the
neighborhood
looked
about
the
same
as
far
as
he
could
tell
But
then
again
he
d
never
really
paid
that
much
attention
to
all
the
details
Some
of
them
might
be
different
and
he
d
never
even
notice
After
what
seemed
a
very
long
time
he
approached
his
own
house
He
examined
it
carefully
It
looked
the
same
as
far
as
he
could
tell
He
took
a
deep
breath
and
went
inside
Hello
dear
he
heard
his
mother
s
voice
come
from
the
kitchen
Did
you
have
a
nice
game
Uh
I
guess
he
called
out
in
reply
It
was
uh
different
That
s
nice
his
mother
answered
Dinner
s
ready
Ernie
walked
into
the
dining
room
He
was
still
feeling
pretty
woozy
Maybe
something
to
eat
would
make
him
feel
better
Ernie
s
mother
entered
carrying
a
large
covered
dish
Ernie
gasped
Mom
Your
hair
Ernie
s
mother
looked
confused
What
about
my
hair
It
it
s
green
Ernie
choked
But
it
s
always
been
green
his
mother
was
puzzled
Are
you
feeling
all
right
dear
boy
Ernie
collapsed
into
a
chair
No
he
moaned
I
don
t
feel
good
at
all
It
must
be
that
awful
Virtual
Reality
Game
his
mother
said
knowingly
I
ve
always
said
those
things
were
unhealthy
It
s
just
too
much
stimulation
for
young
minds
Uh
yeah
Ernie
agreed
pitifully
Have
some
dinner
and
you
ll
feel
better
she
said
wisely
dishing
out
a
plate
of
food
for
Ernie
I
ve
made
your
favorite
squid
with
mothballs
Uh
Ernie
began
Your
favorite
TV
show
s
on
tonight
his
mother
continued
cheerily
I
Wanna
Donna
with
Donna
the
Iguana
In
fact
she
went
on
brightly
All
your
favorite
Reptiles
are
on
tonight
Ernie
sighed
deeply
Well
he
thought
It
looks
like
I
m
home
Sort
of
THE
END
