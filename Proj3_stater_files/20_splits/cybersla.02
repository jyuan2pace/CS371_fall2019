not
really
paying
attention
In
fact
I
happen
to
have
some
with
me
Perhaps
you
d
like
to
see
it
Mmm
Captain
Memory
was
gazing
at
the
view
Sterno
took
his
answer
to
be
a
yes
and
handed
him
a
piece
of
paper
with
some
verses
on
it
Captain
Memory
barely
glanced
at
it
Looks
like
doggerel
to
me
he
said
uncaringly
Sterno
s
mood
turned
black
I
suppose
you
think
that
s
funny
he
snarled
I
open
my
heart
to
you
and
you
mock
me
Well
we
ll
see
who
has
the
last
laugh
I
know
when
I
m
right
I
m
right
and
you
re
wrong
and
that
s
all
there
is
to
it
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Sounds
to
me
like
you
re
being
a
bit
dogmatic
to
me
You
fool
Sterno
barked
You
don
t
even
have
the
vaguest
idea
what
s
going
on
here
You
re
a
fine
one
to
talk
Captain
Memory
abruptly
changed
the
subject
Wanna
watch
some
TV
Ernie
really
didn
t
want
to
watch
any
TV
but
he
was
feeling
very
uncomfortable
with
the
current
drift
of
the
conversation
Maybe
watching
TV
would
be
a
good
way
to
change
the
subject
Uh
this
isn
t
gonna
be
like
last
time
is
it
We
re
not
going
to
get
sucked
into
the
TV
show
again
are
we
Naw
the
Captain
assured
him
That
was
a
fluke
One
in
a
million
chance
It
ll
never
happen
again
Well
okay
then
Ernie
agreed
reluctantly
Captain
Memory
returned
to
the
harpsichord
Um
F
sharp
He
hit
the
appropriate
keys
The
ceiling
view
screen
suddenly
changed
from
a
view
of
space
to
a
television
picture
They
seemed
to
have
tuned
in
to
a
commercial
The
announcer
was
an
dour
looking
man
wearing
a
brown
military
uniform
and
jackboots
He
seemed
to
be
making
a
strenuous
effort
to
be
cheerful
Hi
I
m
Martin
Bohrmann
the
announcer
held
up
two
record
albums
And
if
you
remember
me
you
remember
HITLER
S
GREATEST
HITS
I
don
t
remember
that
said
Ernie
to
no
one
in
particular
Now
together
at
last
on
these
two
long
playing
record
albums
all
time
golden
hits
from
the
Third
Reich
You
get
the
Gestapo
Glee
Club
with
HEIL
HITLER
DEAR
Military
sounding
music
started
up
in
the
background
Do
we
have
to
watch
this
Ernie
complained
you
can
t
buy
these
records
in
any
store
but
if
you
call
this
number
a
secret
messenger
will
knock
on
your
door
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
Oh
okay
I
ll
change
it
Captain
Memory
struck
a
key
on
the
harpsichord
The
screen
changed
to
black
and
white
Characters
in
s
clothing
appeared
It
s
an
old
movie
Ernie
commented
He
felt
better
An
old
movie
that
would
be
safe
right
Nothing
bad
could
happen
out
of
an
old
movie
right
A
man
in
a
suit
with
a
cloth
over
his
head
appeared
on
the
screen
A
pretty
young
woman
came
up
to
him
and
suddenly
yanked
the
cloth
away
Under
the
cloth
the
man
had
the
tremendously
enlarged
head
of
a
fly
complete
with
huge
multifaceted
eyes
antennae
and
a
long
black
snout
The
young
woman
began
to
scream
Hey
I
remember
this
said
Ernie
brightly
It
s
THE
FLY
the
original
version
too
You
know
that
movie
about
the
scientist
who
goes
into
a
matter
transmitter
except
a
fly
gets
in
it
and
he
winds
up
with
the
head
of
a
fly
Hey
this
is
a
great
movie
Ernie
settled
back
to
watch
pleased
that
he
could
finally
watch
something
he
understood
The
movie
cut
to
a
commercial
Hi
I
m
Martin
Bohrmann
and
if
you
remember
me
Ernie
moaned
I
wish
they
wouldn
t
keep
running
the
same
commercial
he
thought
The
commercial
ended
And
now
back
to
THE
DATING
GAME
THE
DATING
GAME
Ernie
sat
bolt
upright
I
don
t
wanna
watch
the
Dating
Game
What
happened
to
my
movie
Captain
Memory
looked
up
Oh
a
game
show
he
said
brightly
He
hadn
t
been
paying
much
attention
up
to
this
point
I
like
game
shows
You
know
you
can
really
get
into
game
shows
I
KNOW
Ernie
interrupted
That
s
what
I
m
AFRAID
of
The
man
on
the
screen
looked
like
a
typical
game
show
host
wearing
a
plaid
polyester
suit
with
a
large
carnation
in
his
lapel
The
only
thing
that
seemed
a
bit
odd
about
him
is
that
he
was
wearing
jackboots
and
a
monocle
Congratulations
he
was
saying
to
an
excited
female
contestant
You
fe
von
an
all
expenses
paid
dream
date
vit
bachelor
number
The
game
show
host
seemed
to
have
a
bit
of
a
German
accent
Oh
I
just
can
t
wait
to
see
him
The
young
woman
was
jumping
up
and
down
with
excitement
Bachelor
number
three
come
on
out
The
game
show
host
called
out
A
door
opened
and
out
stepped
a
man
wearing
a
suit
who
had
the
enormously
enlarged
head
of
a
fly
The
young
woman
began
to
scream
Ernie
looked
confused
Hey
what
are
we
watching
anyway
Is
this
THE
FLY
or
THE
DATING
GAME
or
what
Captain
Memory
was
looking
at
the
TV
Guide
upside
down
Mmm
hmm
he
agreed
not
paying
much
attention
The
host
seemed
to
be
wrapping
the
show
up
Vell
folks
dis
is
Biff
Mozzarella
saying
Wait
a
minute
Sterno
interrupted
I
think
something
smells
around
here
Captain
Memory
looked
up
Got
a
problem
he
asked
unconcernedly
Think
about
it
Sterno
considered
His
name
Mozzarella
Huh
said
Ernie
You
mean
Biff
This
guy
s
name
is
Mozzarella
Sterno
noted
The
last
guys
name
was
Liederkranz
So
asked
Ernie
uncomprehendingly
Cheese
get
it
cried
Sterno
They
re
both
cheese
I
don
t
think
I
like
the
sound
of
this
Ernie
thought
Um
well
you
know
he
began
to
Captain
Memory
Maybe
we
ought
to
give
this
some
consideration
But
it
was
too
late
With
a
deafening
roar
the
delicate
panel
doors
to
the
room
were
blown
off
their
hinges
A
dozen
armed
men
rushed
in
pointing
wicked
looking
weapons
at
the
trio
FREEZE
one
of
them
shouted
Captain
Memory
looked
uncomprehending
It
seems
a
bit
warm
for
that
he
commented
The
group
of
armed
men
parted
to
make
way
for
an
unpleasant
looking
man
wearing
a
black
military
uniform
jackboots
and
a
monocle
Zo
ve
meet
again
The
man
did
in
fact
look
somewhat
familiar
to
Ernie
Haven
t
I
seen
you
somewhere
before
The
man
smiled
warmly
No
doubt
you
ve
seen
my
TV
show
THE
TORTURE
GAME
is
a
big
hit
these
days
I
m
He
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
Sturmbannfuhrer
Dr
Heinz
von
Liederkranz
the
Gestapo
s
greatest
He
paused
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
applause
His
men
looked
at
each
other
quickly
and
began
clapping
Ernie
thought
it
might
be
a
good
idea
if
he
applauded
too
ENOUGH
Von
Liederkranz
silenced
his
men
with
a
quick
sweep
of
his
riding
crop
leaving
Ernie
applauding
feebly
all
by
himself
Ernie
looked
around
and
quickly
stopped
Von
Liederkranz
prodded
Captain
Memory
in
the
chest
with
his
riding
crop
Now
You
will
tell
us
your
name
rank
and
serial
number
My
what
Captain
Memory
looked
uncomprehending
Your
name
rank
and
serial
number
Name
rank
and
cereal
number
mused
the
Captain
But
I
never
even
eat
cereal
Do
not
be
coy
with
us
snapped
the
Sturmbannfuhrer
We
know
you
are
one
of
Them
Ve
know
you
are
a
spy
on
a
mission
of
sabotage
and
destruction
He
paused
calculatingly
Remember
ve
have
vays
of
making
you
talk
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
in
confusion
Who
are
these
guys
anyway
They
LOOK
like
a
bunch
of
Nazis
the
Captain
replied
thoughtfully
But
they
COULD
be
Enough
von
Liederkranz
broke
in
You
vill
answer
our
questions
Captain
Memory
concentrated
How
about
Who
Put
the
Bop
in
the
Bop
Shu
Bop
Shu
Bop
he
suggested
Von
Liederkranz
s
tone
abruptly
changed
You
know
he
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Ve
do
not
haff
to
be
enemies
Ve
could
be
friends
You
vould
like
to
be
friends
nein
Sure
Captain
Memory
was
nothing
if
not
agreeable
Then
tell
us
vot
ve
vant
to
know
Okay
The
Captain
thought
a
minute
The
attack
is
set
for
exactly
Julius
Caesar
will
march
on
Omaha
and
the
Enterprise
will
attack
the
Titanic
somewhere
in
the
South
China
Sea
Then
Patton
will
drive
up
through
the
south
of
France
make
a
right
onto
Route
go
down
three
stop
lights
turn
right
and
it
s
the
third
house
from
the
corner
Just
as
ve
thought
This
of
course
was
not
what
the
Sturmbannfuhrer
had
thought
at
all
However
he
had
to
maintain
a
good
appearance
in
front
of
his
men
He
smiled
amiably
Please
go
on
Captain
Memory
decided
it
was
time
to
stop
I
think
I
ve
said
too
much
already
Von
Liederkranz
s
face
turned
hard
You
misunderstand
he
said
menacingly
I
m
not
asking
you
I
m
TELLING
YOU
TALK
NOW
I
d
really
rather
not
Captain
Memory
didn
t
seem
to
be
too
upset
by
the
proceedings
Ernie
however
was
beginning
to
sweat
Sterno
was
glaring
at
the
other
two
giving
them
an
I
told
you
so
look
Von
Liederkranz
smiled
sadistically
You
can
t
escape
you
know
Ve
haff
total
control
of
all
computation
in
zis
sector
Ze
system
vill
not
accept
commands
from
anyone
but
me
Dere
is
no
vay
out
Ve
have
you
vhere
ve
vant
you
Well
Captain
Memory
began
I
m
afraid
I
don
t
have
time
So
be
it
cried
von
Liederkranz
If
dat
s
de
vay
you
are
going
to
be
bring
on
de
Hot
Vhirling
Corkscrew
Captain
Memory
looked
pained
You
know
I
really
don
t
care
for
the
Hot
Vhirling
I
mean
Whirling
Corkscrew
Von
Liederkranz
laughed
sadistically
You
are
very
funny
Ve
vill
see
how
funny
you
vill
be
after
a
few
hours
vit
mein
Corkscrew
Captain
Memory
seemed
offended
Well
if
you
re
going
to
be
like
that
I
m
simply
going
to
have
to
leave
Von
Liederkranz
laughed
sadistically
again
In
fact
he
didn
t
seem
to
be
able
to
laugh
any
other
way
Dere
is
no
way
out
von
Liederkranz
continued
You
cannot
break
into
ze
system
from
here
Ernie
noticed
his
stomach
beginning
to
hurt
again
Stress
he
thought
It
s
not
good
for
me
to
be
under
this
much
stress
I
think
it
s
affecting
my
health
Maybe
I
m
getting
an
ulcer
Von
Liederkranz
switched
on
his
Hot
Whirling
Corkscrew
which
true
to
it
s
name
began
to
whirl
and
glow
Laughing
sadistically
as
usual
he
began
to
bring
it
closer
and
closer
to
Captain
Memory
s
face
The
torture
device
edged
ever
nearer
inch
by
inch
spinning
and
hissing
as
it
approached
Captain
Memory
s
unprotected
face
Ernie
shut
his
eyes
tightly
It
s
too
horrible
he
thought
I
can
t
watch
He
waited
for
the
inevitable
screams
Captain
Memory
looked
miffed
Okay
be
like
that
JMP
F
Ernie
opened
his
eyes
The
rococo
sitting
room
had
vanished
They
seemed
to
be
back
in
the
huge
Chicago
living
room
that
they
had
originally
found
themselves
in
after
leaving
the
Simulation
Arcade
Ernie
s
head
swam
This
is
all
changing
too
fast
for
me
he
thought
I
just
can
t
keep
up
with
it
He
found
a
chair
and
sat
down
Ernie
didn
t
feel
well
at
all
Captain
Memory
was
strolling
around
ruefully
inspecting
the
surroundings
Look
at
this
place
he
lamented
What
a
mess
Ernie
looked
about
The
place
was
in
fact
in
dismal
shape
The
walls
were
covered
with
soot
the
furniture
was
singed
Much
of
the
furniture
was
knocked
over
some
was
totally
splintered
It
looked
rather
like
a
bomb
had
gone
off
in
the
room
Ernie
recovered
enough
composure
to
speak
Why
why
are
we
back
here
Oh
I
apologize
for
that
Captain
Memory
explained
I
just
couldn
t
think
of
anyplace
else
on
such
short
notice
I
should
have
known
this
place
would
be
a
mess
Ernie
looked
around
Yeah
this
place
has
really
gone
to
the
dogs
I
suppose
you
think
that
s
funny
Sterno
growled
Ernie
noticed
two
piles
of
burned
rags
lying
near
the
TV
set
They
were
still
smoldering
slightly
He
shuddered
He
would
rather
not
think
about
what
might
have
happened
here
Well
well
Ernie
started
again
How
did
we
get
here
That
Nazi
said
we
couldn
t
escape
He
said
they
controlled
all
computation
in
the
sector
That
s
right
Captain
Memory
smiled
We
JUMPed
to
a
different
sector
Ernie
decided
to
just
accept
that
explanation
even
though
he
didn
t
entirely
understand
it
Makes
about
as
much
sense
as
anything
else
Sterno
agreed
He
seemed
to
have
found
another
cigar
and
was
puffing
away
on
it
contentedly
He
seemed
to
be
in
a
much
better
mood
whenever
he
had
a
cigar
Pity
you
couldn
t
have
transported
that
brandy
along
with
us
though
Ernie
was
desperately
trying
to
make
sense
of
all
of
this
So
who
were
those
Nazi
guys
anyway
That
s
hard
to
say
for
sure
CM
said
thoughtfully
They
re
probably
Cyberslaves
just
like
you
would
have
been
if
I
hadn
t
rescued
you
Ernie
shuddered
He
really
didn
t
like
the
sound
of
that
Cyberslave
stuff
What
about
their
leader
Von
Liederkranz
Sterno
wondered
He
didn
t
look
a
slave
In
fact
he
seemed
to
be
having
a
really
good
time
The
Captain
nodded
I
m
sure
he
s
not
a
slave
he
agreed
He
s
one
of
the
Slavemasters
In
fact
Captain
Memory
furled
his
brow
in
thought
He
MIGHT
even
be
Waldo
Stadium
himself
So
what
are
we
doing
in
all
of
this
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
Hopeless
Don
t
pick
on
the
kid
Captain
Memory
defended
Ernie
Yeah
Ernie
agreed
After
all
Captain
Memory
continued
It
s
not
his
fault
he
s
stupid
Yeah
it
s
Ernie
broke
off
That
wasn
t
turning
out
the
way
he
d
hoped
Sterno
looked
at
the
Captain
So
what
kind
of
super
hero
are
you
supposed
to
be
anyway
Me
Captain
Memory
expounded
Why
I
m
a
strange
visitor
from
another
planet
who
came
to
Earth
with
powers
and
abilities
far
beyond
those
of
mortal
men
Powers
and
abilities
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Like
what
Captain
Memory
continued
expansively
I
m
faster
than
a
speeding
bullet
more
powerful
than
a
locomotive
why
I
can
even
leap
tall
buildings
in
a
single
bound
This
was
beginning
to
sound
a
bit
familiar
to
Ernie
Anything
else
I
can
also
change
the
course
of
mighty
rivers
and
bend
steel
in
my
bare
hands
I
ve
got
it
now
thought
Ernie
You
don
t
by
any
chance
tend
to
go
around
disguised
as
Clark
Kent
mild
mannered
reporter
for
a
great
metropolitan
newspaper
and
fight
a
never
ending
battle
for
truth
justice
and
the
American
way
do
you
Captain
Memory
looked
totally
mystified
Why
no
Why
would
I
want
to
do
a
thing
like
that
Ernie
was
nonplussed
Well
I
dunno
I
just
sort
of
thought
He
trailed
off
There
was
an
awkward
silence
Sterno
cleared
his
throat
You
don
t
suppose
these
people
keep
caviar
about
somewhere
do
you
Grateful
for
the
interruption
Ernie
began
searching
He
found
a
small
white
cabinet
that
looked
like
it
might
be
a
refrigerator
Ah
He
pulled
out
a
small
jar
How
s
this
Sterno
examined
the
jar
ruefully
Oh
he
sniffed
American
caviar
Well
I
suppose
Beluga
was
a
bit
too
much
to
ask
We
ll
just
have
to
rough
it
I
imagine
He
looked
around
You
wouldn
t
happen
to
have
a
slice
of
fresh
onion
by
any
chance
Captain
Memory
had
returned
to
perusing
the
TV
Guide
Wanna
watch
some
TV
he
asked
brightly
It
s
almost
time
for
that
great
game
show
about
the
dinosaur
age
Which
one
is
that
Ernie
couldn
t
recall
any
shows
about
dinosaurs
Oh
I
m
sure
you
ve
seen
it
It
s
real
famous
the
Captain
explained
It
s
called
YOU
BET
JURASSIC
Ernie
frowned
Something
about
that
name
did
seem
a
bit
familiar
All
these
familiar
sounding
things
that
he
couldn
t
quite
place
were
making
him
very
uneasy
Suddenly
the
television
came
on
Prepare
to
die
inferior
creatures
the
speaker
blared
Ernie
was
annoyed
I
thought
we
turned
that
off
Captain
Memory
looked
upset
Oh
dear
I
forgot
about
that
Ernie
began
to
get
that
queasy
feeling
in
his
stomach
again
Forgot
about
WHAT
The
television
screen
showed
a
huge
purple
vegetable
lifting
itself
up
on
a
green
stalk
It
seemed
to
be
gloating
insofar
as
a
vegetable
can
gloat
You
will
soon
respire
your
last
animal
scum
the
vegetable
continued
No
longer
shall
we
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
be
your
helpless
victims
to
be
bred
and
destroyed
at
your
whims
The
day
of
reckoning
is
here
at
last
Prepare
to
receive
the
Vengeance
of
the
Vegetables
Ernie
shifted
his
weight
uncomfortably
This
sure
is
a
weird
program
Oh
it
s
not
a
program
Captain
Memory
explained
The
Killer
Eggplants
are
about
to
attack
Ernie
thought
he
d
better
sit
down
again
Huh
I
told
you
we
re
in
a
game
called
ATTACK
OF
THE
KILLER
EGGPLANTS
Captain
Memory
regarded
his
bare
wrist
Oh
dear
it
s
been
almost
forty
five
minutes
Ernie
didn
t
get
it
I
don
t
get
it
he
said
Remember
those
nukes
I
told
you
about
Ernie
didn
t
like
the
sound
of
this
He
tried
to
put
the
pieces
together
They
re
going
to
nuke
us
Afraid
so
said
Captain
Memory
cheerily
He
didn
t
seem
particularly
upset
at
the
idea
WHY
To
put
an
end
to
the
Revolt
of
the
Vegetables
Captain
Memory
explained
And
fry
the
Great
Eggplant
once
and
for
all
Ernie
was
trying
hard
to
understand
all
of
this
let
me
get
this
straight
you
mean
the
vegetables
have
risen
up
in
revolt
Of
course
not
Captain
Memory
laughed
How
could
vegetables
possibly
do
a
thing
like
that
Ernie
was
getting
frustrated
Then
WHAT
is
GOING
ON
Captain
Memory
chuckled
Oh
it
s
all
a
big
practical
joke
Ernie
felt
relieved
Then
they
re
NOT
going
to
nuke
Chicago
Oh
no
they
re
really
going
to
do
it
Captain
Memory
seemed
to
think
this
was
all
very
funny
After
all
they
don
t
know
it
s
a
joke
do
they
It
wouldn
t
be
very
funny
if
they
KNEW
it
was
a
joke
would
it
Captain
Memory
chuckled
Nope
they
re
going
to
bomb
the
whole
city
back
to
the
Stone
Age
Ernie
heard
the
sound
of
jets
flying
very
close
by
outside
He
began
to
feel
very
uneasy
So
um
what
are
we
going
to
do
Do
asked
Captain
Memory
innocently
Ernie
began
to
feel
an
intense
heat
radiating
through
the
walls
He
clenched
his
eyes
tightly
closed
I
ll
just
close
my
eyes
he
thought
Maybe
when
I
open
them
again
this
will
all
be
gone
He
opened
his
eyes
It
was
all
gone
Ernie
was
taken
aback
Wow
he
thought
It
worked
He
looked
around
They
were
in
the
midst
of
a
grassy
field
studded
with
wildflowers
Bright
sunshine
bathed
the
scene
Captain
Memory
was
idly
toying
with
blades
of
grass
Sterno
was
sniffing
the
flowers
Where
are
we
Ernie
asked
dumbly
Why
the
Stone
Age
of
course
Captain
Memory
seemed
to
think
this
was
quite
obvious
Somewhere
in
the
Jurassic
period
I
think
You
knew
this
would
happen
Ernie
cried
Sure
replied
the
Captain
offhandedly
It
s
part
of
the
game
Ernie
sighed
A
gentle
breeze
swayed
the
tall
grass
He
could
hear
birdsongs
in
the
distance
It
all
seemed
very
peaceful
Good
thought
Ernie
I
could
use
a
break
He
lay
down
in
the
grass
and
rested
At
least
he
thought
we
won
t
have
to
watch
any
TV
The
sun
moved
slowly
across
the
sky
as
the
hours
passed
After
a
time
Ernie
sat
up
It
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
be
getting
a
sunburn
So
what
are
we
gonna
do
in
the
Stone
Age
he
asked
Get
stoned
Sterno
offered
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
I
m
glad
you
mentioned
that
he
said
It
s
time
we
were
on
our
way
I
knew
I
shouldn
t
have
said
anything
Ernie
thought
Oh
well
it
s
too
late
now
So
now
what
We
d
better
find
a
cave
before
it
gets
dark
don
t
you
think
Captain
Memory
said
cheerily
Wouldn
t
want
to
have
a
run
in
with
one
of
those
saber
tooth
tigers
would
we
Ernie
frowned
He
had
forgotten
that
there
would
be
things
like
saber
tooth
tigers
in
the
Stone
Age
although
he
supposed
he
should
have
realized
that
It
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
Stone
Age
caves
often
held
giant
cave
bears
Um
maybe
we
should
think
about
this
he
called
out
to
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
however
was
already
far
ahead
of
Ernie
striding
