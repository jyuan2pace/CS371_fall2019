was
all
giving
him
a
terrible
headache
Suddenly
a
thought
occurred
to
him
Hey
this
is
all
really
just
a
game
right
Captain
Memory
looked
annoyed
No
it
is
not
a
game
It
never
was
a
game
Will
you
PLEASE
stop
saying
that
Ernie
moaned
quietly
Captain
Memory
glanced
at
his
wrist
We
d
better
hurry
We
re
running
out
of
time
Ernie
looked
up
You
don
t
have
a
watch
he
said
suspiciously
Captain
Memory
continued
to
look
at
his
bare
wrist
Well
no
he
said
a
bit
crestfallen
I
always
wanted
one
though
Ernie
looked
around
Can
t
we
just
stay
here
It
s
nice
here
They
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
large
living
room
of
a
well
kept
home
It
appeared
to
be
furnished
in
Fabulous
Fifties
style
except
for
a
few
odd
objects
that
Ernie
couldn
t
identify
We
can
t
stay
in
one
place
to
long
replied
Captain
Memory
Waldo
Stadium
is
sorting
his
data
as
fast
as
he
can
If
we
stay
in
one
place
too
long
sooner
or
later
he
ll
zero
in
on
us
Anyway
Captain
Memory
looked
around
This
place
is
beginning
to
look
kind
of
familiar
to
me
If
I
m
right
this
isn
t
a
safe
place
to
be
Okay
then
where
are
we
the
dog
demanded
I
think
we
ve
landed
in
a
game
called
ATTACK
OF
THE
GIANT
EGGPLANT
If
I
m
right
this
place
is
going
to
be
nuked
in
he
glanced
at
his
bare
wrist
again
oh
forty
five
minutes
or
so
Ernie
began
to
be
aware
of
a
queasy
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
This
is
making
me
anxious
he
thought
I
m
not
going
to
do
things
like
this
anymore
That
s
it
no
more
Virtual
Reality
for
me
Maybe
you
d
like
to
watch
some
TV
Captain
Memory
suggested
cheerfully
Maybe
that
would
make
you
feel
better
I
thought
we
were
in
a
hurry
Ernie
answered
We
can
watch
for
a
couple
minutes
the
Captain
replied
I
guess
that
makes
as
much
sense
as
anything
else
Ernie
thought
and
followed
the
Captain
towards
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
he
noticed
a
television
with
a
ten
foot
wide
screen
playing
with
the
sound
turned
off
As
they
approached
the
television
Ernie
noticed
a
large
high
backed
s
style
sofa
positioned
close
in
front
of
the
TV
As
they
came
around
the
side
of
the
sofa
Ernie
was
startled
to
see
two
people
sitting
there
staring
intently
at
the
television
screen
Hey
Ernie
uttered
involuntarily
The
two
people
seemed
oblivious
to
Ernie
s
presence
Um
hello
Ernie
said
tentatively
Excuse
me
The
people
did
not
respond
Captain
Memory
sighed
It
s
too
late
for
them
I
m
afraid
Ernie
moaned
I
wished
you
d
stop
saying
depressing
things
It
makes
my
stomach
hurt
Oh
sorry
Captain
Memory
seemed
concerned
Um
how
about
It
s
too
late
for
them
I
m
pleased
to
say
That
s
not
much
better
Captain
Memory
shrugged
Hey
I
tried
He
fell
silent
Ernie
looked
at
the
people
They
seemed
frozen
into
position
staring
at
the
television
They
seemed
emaciated
their
muscles
seemed
to
have
withered
in
the
positions
they
were
in
Okay
so
what
s
wrong
with
them
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
They
ve
been
in
Cyberspace
too
long
he
said
sadly
There
s
a
limit
to
how
much
of
this
you
can
take
you
know
Your
brain
burns
out
I
don
t
think
these
two
have
much
longer
All
they
can
do
is
sit
here
in
front
of
the
TV
Captain
Memory
sighed
Terrible
just
terrible
Look
at
them
they
can
t
even
change
channels
anymore
Ernie
shuddered
This
is
gruesome
he
thought
I
think
it
s
bad
for
me
to
look
at
gruesome
things
Oh
well
Captain
Memory
brightened
Can
t
be
helped
The
Captain
unceremoniously
pushed
the
stricken
couple
off
the
sofa
They
fell
stiffly
to
the
floor
motionless
except
for
their
eyes
which
rotated
to
stay
fixed
on
the
television
screen
Captain
Memory
seated
himself
as
comfortably
as
possible
on
the
sofa
So
what
do
you
want
to
watch
They
heard
a
voice
behind
them
Crap
The
dog
was
looking
ruefully
at
his
half
burned
cigar
and
cursing
quietly
What
s
the
matter
Captain
Memory
inquired
cheerfully
I
m
almost
out
of
cigars
the
dog
groused
Here
I
am
stuck
in
this
stupid
pointless
computer
game
and
I
can
t
even
get
a
decent
cigar
Well
maybe
we
can
get
you
some
more
uh
what
was
your
name
again
The
Captain
inquired
Sterno
The
dog
intoned
pompously
Sterno
said
Ernie
dubiously
What
kind
of
a
name
is
that
Sterno
is
those
little
cans
of
heating
stuff
I
ll
have
you
know
that
I
am
Lord
High
Keeper
of
the
Sacred
Flame
Why
in
better
days
Oh
I
remember
now
the
Captain
broke
in
brightly
That
s
a
game
called
DOG
STAR
You
must
have
been
playing
it
when
Waldo
took
over
your
system
That
s
why
you
re
trapped
in
the
body
of
a
dog
Sterno
was
taken
aback
Uh
well
yeah
I
was
Lord
High
Keeper
of
the
Sacred
Flame
huh
the
Captain
continued
You
were
doing
pretty
good
Sterno
brightened
Well
yes
as
a
matter
of
fact
Wanna
watch
Stump
the
Stars
Captain
Memory
said
to
Ernie
cutting
off
Sterno
s
tales
of
past
glory
What
s
that
about
inquired
Ernie
It
s
this
game
show
where
famous
Hollywood
celebrities
have
to
answer
these
questions
and
if
they
get
them
wrong
they
get
their
arms
and
legs
chopped
off
Stumps
get
it
Captain
Memory
laughed
Ernie
frowned
I
don
t
like
these
new
game
shows
He
glanced
at
the
television
The
program
seemed
to
be
a
game
show
The
MC
was
an
unpleasant
looking
man
wearing
a
black
military
uniform
with
skulls
on
the
collar
He
wore
a
monocle
in
his
left
eye
and
carried
a
riding
crop
which
he
periodically
cracked
against
his
jackboots
Oh
it
s
one
of
those
sadistic
Nazi
game
show
hosts
said
Ernie
Isn
t
there
anything
else
on
Captain
Memory
was
paging
through
a
copy
of
TV
Guide
Doesn
t
look
like
there
s
anything
on
except
game
shows
How
about
Vomit
for
Dollars
Ernie
grimaced
Here
s
a
movie
the
Captain
continued
How
about
The
Humpback
of
Notre
Dame
starring
Ronald
Reagan
You
know
the
one
about
the
whale
that
plays
football
Ernie
sighed
What
s
this
we
re
watching
now
I
don
t
know
Captain
Memory
reached
for
a
dial
Let
s
turn
up
the
volume
and
find
out
The
off
camera
announcer
s
voice
came
blasting
out
off
the
set
painfully
loud
time
for
Wheel
of
Torture
The
show
which
every
week
asks
the
question
How
much
can
you
take
The
sound
of
applause
welled
up
from
the
audience
And
here
s
our
host
the
announcer
continued
The
Gestapo
s
greatest
that
famous
fiend
Sturmbannfuhrer
Dr
Heinz
von
Liederkranz
Once
again
the
sound
of
applause
welled
up
The
sound
seemed
to
be
growing
impossibly
loud
In
fact
it
seemed
to
be
coming
from
all
around
them
The
game
show
host
smiled
and
bowed
to
the
audience
Tank
you
tank
you
Now
let
s
drag
in
today
s
first
victim
The
announcer
continued
From
Palo
Alto
California
let
s
have
a
big
round
of
applause
for
CAPTAIN
MEMORY
The
huge
waves
of
applause
filled
Ernie
s
head
blocking
out
everything
else
He
clenched
his
eyes
tightly
trying
to
regain
his
composure
He
opened
them
again
and
staggered
back
in
shock
They
were
no
longer
in
the
suburban
living
room
They
were
actually
standing
on
the
stage
that
they
had
been
watching
only
seconds
before
They
had
actually
been
sucked
INTO
the
game
show
Captain
Memory
seemed
confused
Hey
uh
wait
a
minute
I
didn
t
The
announcer
continued
And
here
s
contestant
number
two
From
the
Land
that
Time
Forgets
let
s
have
a
big
hand
for
Goombah
the
Barbarian
Ernie
realized
that
they
meant
him
A
Nazi
SS
trooper
grabbed
him
and
shoved
him
roughly
forward
Hey
lemme
go
ow
Look
I
m
not
supposed
Say
I
just
LOVE
your
loincloth
the
announcer
quipped
Ernie
could
hear
the
audience
laughing
He
began
to
feel
terribly
self
conscious
And
what
a
CUTE
little
dog
the
announcer
went
on
Sterno
didn
t
seem
to
be
particularly
bothered
by
the
state
of
affairs
Say
you
got
a
cigar
Why
SURE
The
announcer
handed
him
one
The
audience
chuckled
The
announcer
continued
Well
all
RIGHT
then
Dr
von
Liederkranz
what
are
we
going
to
start
out
with
today
The
Nazi
smiled
theatrically
Vell
Biff
I
tought
I
d
shtart
out
vit
a
liddle
infention
of
mein
own
de
Hot
Vhirling
Corshcrew
He
pulled
out
a
fiendish
looking
device
made
of
glowing
whirling
metal
parts
Without
warning
he
jabbed
Captain
Memory
with
it
The
Captain
let
out
a
blood
curdling
shriek
The
audience
applauded
wildly
VERY
good
The
announcer
exclaimed
jovially
Now
let
s
see
how
that
rated
on
our
applause
meter
A
Well
that
s
Forget
this
shouted
Captain
Memory
JMP
F
Suddenly
Ernie
found
himself
back
on
the
porcelain
sofa
The
TV
was
now
off
Ernie
was
trembling
Wha
what
happened
Captain
Memory
was
rubbing
his
side
ruefully
Oh
I
JUMPed
us
back
here
I
really
didn
t
like
that
Hot
Whirling
Corkscrew
Good
cigar
though
Sterno
added
puffing
away
The
cigar
seemed
to
have
improved
his
disposition
somewhat
I
I
don
t
understand
Ernie
whined
You
know
how
in
a
lot
of
computer
games
there
s
these
little
doors
or
windows
or
something
and
when
you
step
through
them
you
re
on
a
whole
different
level
Captain
Memory
asked
Yeah
Ernie
replied
tentatively
Well
the
Captain
gestured
towards
the
TV
That
s
one
of
them
Ernie
noticed
an
odd
smell
He
glanced
towards
the
floor
The
two
shrivelled
people
were
vibrating
Wisps
of
smoke
seemed
to
be
coming
out
of
their
ears
Oh
I
forgot
said
the
Captain
You
re
never
supposed
to
turn
the
TV
off
on
these
people
Something
bad
happens
I
forget
exactly
what
but
it
s
real
bad
Ernie
continued
to
watch
the
couple
in
horror
The
smoke
was
coming
more
heavily
new
Their
foreheads
seemed
to
be
bulging
What
what
are
we
gonna
do
Ernie
choked
out
Captain
Memory
regarded
his
bare
wrist
carefully
Some
day
I
m
gonna
get
a
watch
he
said
thoughtfully
I
really
think
we
ought
to
do
something
said
Ernie
anxiously
Smoke
was
coming
out
of
their
noses
now
Light
seemed
to
be
appearing
behind
their
eyes
A
silver
watch
might
be
nice
Do
you
think
silver
would
look
good
with
this
outfit
Captain
Memory
wondered
I
really
REALLY
think
we
ought
to
do
something
said
Ernie
urgently
The
TV
addicts
bodies
were
beginning
to
swell
rapidly
Ernie
inched
away
from
them
Oh
well
said
Captain
Memory
unhurriedly
I
guess
it
s
time
to
go
Uh
let
s
see
He
thought
a
moment
Let
s
try
PUSH
FF
C
With
that
they
were
gone
Ernie
blinked
and
staggered
The
scene
had
changed
completely
Now
he
saw
an
elaborate
th
century
drawing
room
around
him
The
walls
were
decorated
with
filigreed
mirrors
and
candelabras
Delicate
furniture
surrounded
them
It
all
looked
very
expensive
Captain
Memory
looked
about
obviously
pleased
with
himself
Hey
it
worked
Ernie
s
head
swam
He
felt
confused
and
disoriented
These
abrupt
changes
of
scene
were
making
him
sick
He
sagged
into
a
chair
I
don
t
feel
very
good
he
complained
Sterno
puffed
his
cigar
This
is
almost
decent
he
mused
You
don
t
suppose
there
s
a
snifter
of
brandy
about
do
you
The
sound
of
a
harpsichord
drifted
in
from
somewhere
Ah
Telemann
Sterno
commented
Very
tasteful
Captain
Memory
turned
to
Ernie
Gee
I
m
sorry
you
re
not
feeling
well
he
commiserated
Would
it
make
you
feel
better
to
watch
some
TV
Ernie
sat
bolt
upright
NO
The
Captain
had
brought
along
his
copy
of
TV
Guide
You
re
missing
the
Ozzie
and
Hitler
Show
I
don
t
care
This
is
a
good
episode
Ozzie
forgets
that
the
boss
is
coming
for
dinner
so
Hitler
has
to
invade
Poland
on
a
moment
s
notice
Captain
Memory
chuckled
I
don
t
like
these
TV
programs
grumbled
Ernie
Well
you
know
said
Captain
Memory
conversationally
If
you
re
going
to
travel
to
other
Realities
you
re
not
always
going
to
be
able
to
get
your
favorite
TV
shows
I
want
to
go
home
Ernie
sulked
Suddenly
a
thought
occurred
to
him
He
brightened
Hey
this
is
really
just
a
game
right
Sterno
glared
at
him
This
game
business
is
getting
really
old
Knock
it
off
okay
Ernie
had
begun
methodically
feeling
the
furniture
He
reasoned
that
if
it
were
a
Virtual
Reality
illusion
he
would
be
able
to
see
it
but
since
it
had
no
substance
he
wouldn
t
be
able
to
feel
it
If
my
hand
goes
right
through
this
stuff
he
figured
I
ll
know
it
s
just
an
illusion
Unfortunately
everything
was
proving
to
be
distressingly
solid
You
know
you
look
really
stupid
in
that
fur
loincloth
Sterno
commented
And
what
in
the
world
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
ridiculous
plastic
broadsword
Well
I
hadda
put
a
deposit
on
it
said
Ernie
defensively
If
I
don
t
bring
it
back
I
lose
bucks
Sterno
shook
his
head
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Do
we
really
have
to
drag
this
kid
around
with
us
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
I
m
afraid
so
Why
Sterno
demanded
Well
you
know
the
Captain
said
off
handedly
We
can
t
just
leave
him
to
be
a
Cyberslave
It
wouldn
t
be
you
know
nice
A
thought
occurred
to
Ernie
So
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
all
of
this
anyway
Hmm
Captain
Memory
still
perusing
the
TV
Guide
was
not
paying
very
much
attention
Like
are
we
just
going
to
keep
bopping
around
Cyberspace
or
what
I
mean
do
you
have
a
Plan
or
something
Captain
Memory
pulled
himself
up
Of
course
I
have
a
Plan
He
turned
to
Sterno
See
I
have
Powers
and
I
have
a
Plan
Okay
okay
Sterno
agreed
wearily
You
re
a
fine
super
hero
So
what
s
the
plan
We
have
to
find
a
way
to
terminate
this
reality
within
the
confines
of
it
s
own
logic
the
Captain
explained
Huh
Ernie
didn
t
follow
this
We
have
to
end
the
game
the
Captain
rephrased
We
have
to
carry
it
through
to
it
s
logical
conclusion
so
that
it
terminates
and
shuts
down
Ernie
frowned
What
s
the
point
of
this
game
anyway
That
s
a
problem
the
Captain
admitted
This
isn
t
a
game
It
s
dozens
maybe
hundreds
of
games
all
stuck
together
in
no
order
The
point
of
what
we
re
in
now
could
be
the
point
of
any
of
the
games
or
all
of
them
or
none
of
them
There
s
no
way
to
tell
Luckily
we
don
t
have
to
win
the
game
we
just
have
to
end
it
Any
ending
that
s
logically
consistent
will
do
Sterno
frowned
Why
do
you
have
to
end
it
within
it
s
own
logic
system
Couldn
t
you
just
crash
it
Captain
Memory
sighed
I
could
crash
the
system
but
it
wouldn
t
be
a
good
idea
Why
not
Sterno
demanded
Why
can
t
you
just
insert
some
totally
impossible
instruction
and
crash
out
the
whole
system
Then
this
whole
thing
would
be
over
and
we
could
get
out
of
here
That
s
true
the
Captain
admitted
but
you
d
get
some
bad
um
side
effects
Like
what
Sterno
wanted
to
know
You
see
Captain
Memory
explained
After
you
ve
been
in
Cyberspace
for
a
while
you
brain
gets
synchronized
with
it
and
your
system
becomes
adapted
to
it
If
it
suddenly
crashes
it
causes
a
tremendous
shock
to
your
system
What
you
mean
we
re
going
through
all
this
just
to
avoid
an
upset
stomach
or
something
Sterno
asked
sarcastically
After
all
how
bad
could
it
be
Well
um
the
Captain
looked
very
uncomfortable
It
s
not
just
an
upset
stomach
Okay
Sterno
demanded
Then
what
DOES
it
cause
Um
generally
cardiac
arrest
the
Captain
answered
reluctantly
Sterno
was
shocked
You
mean
if
you
crash
the
system
it
ll
KILL
us
Afraid
so
the
Captain
nodded
sadly
Along
with
anybody
else
who
s
hooked
into
the
system
at
the
time
Ernie
began
to
worry
What
about
ending
the
game
then
Won
t
that
kill
us
too
Does
that
mean
we
re
trapped
here
forever
He
began
to
panic
No
no
calm
down
said
the
Captain
reassuringly
if
we
end
the
game
within
the
confines
of
it
s
own
logic
it
ll
shut
down
in
an
orderly
manner
giving
your
systems
time
to
readjust
before
you
re
returned
to
reality
It
won
t
be
a
shock
to
your
systems
and
your
hearts
won
t
stop
It
s
only
if
it
suddenly
abruptly
stops
like
when
the
system
crashes
that
Okay
okay
we
get
the
picture
Sterno
broke
it
Don
t
crash
the
system
Okay
Captain
Memory
returned
to
the
TV
Guide
Ernie
sighed
It
was
bad
enough
being
trapped
in
a
computer
game
Now
his
life
was
in
danger
as
well
And
his
only
hope
seems
to
be
this
costumed
clown
who
thinks
he
s
a
super
hero
Wasn
t
this
ever
going
to
stop
getting
worse
Suddenly
Captain
Memory
started
Oh
NO
he
wailed
Not
THAT
What
happened
What
happened
cried
Ernie
panic
stricken
What
could
possibly
have
happened
that
was
worse
than
the
predicament
they
were
already
in
Captain
Memory
was
still
holding
the
TV
Guide
We
missed
Gilligan
s
Island
Ernie
cradled
his
head
in
his
hands
I
can
t
stand
it
I
just
can
t
stand
it
Chapter
Ernie
was
beginning
to
feel
a
little
bit
better
After
all
nothing
really
weird
had
happened
for
about
oh
twenty
minutes
or
so
Things
were
relatively
speaking
pretty
quiet
Ernie
examined
his
surroundings
What
is
this
place
It
s
a
spaceship
said
Captain
Memory
conversationally
Ernie
was
skeptical
It
doesn
t
LOOK
like
a
spaceship
Sterno
sniffed
They
don
t
have
to
always
be
those
ghastly
chrome
and
glass
space
things
Utterly
tasteless
This
place
Sterno
looked
about
approvingly
Is
actually
not
bad
Ernie
was
unconvinced
It
s
not
moving
Sure
it
is
the
Captain
returned
You
just
can
t
feel
it
Wanna
look
out
Captain
Memory
stood
up
and
walked
over
to
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
harpsichord
He
regarded
the
keys
Let
s
see
Um
C
Major
He
hit
the
appropriate
keys
With
a
deep
rumbling
sound
the
ceiling
slid
back
revealing
a
view
of
deep
space
Ah
Captain
Memory
was
pleased
He
returned
to
the
sofa
Ernie
regarded
the
view
with
amazement
Stars
and
galaxies
burned
brightly
against
the
blackness
of
space
They
seemed
to
be
an
incredible
distance
from
Earth
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Where
ARE
we
The
Captain
shrugged
Space
But
where
in
space
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Are
we
far
from
Earth
Captain
Memory
concentrated
Let
s
see
um
Long
long
ago
in
a
galaxy
far
far
Ernie
frowned
The
Captain
stopped
Wait
that
s
not
right
He
furrowed
his
brow
Well
I
can
t
exactly
recall
where
we
are
but
it
doesn
t
really
matter
Captain
Memory
was
absorbed
in
looking
at
the
vista
of
deep
space
After
all
when
you
wish
upon
a
star
it
makes
no
difference
where
you
are
Ernie
frowned
Something
about
that
bugs
me
It
doesn
t
sound
quite
cricket
agreed
Sterno
Well
by
jiminy
exclaimed
the
Captain
We
ll
just
have
to
move
on
to
something
else
Wanna
watch
some
TV
I
d
rather
not
said
Ernie
Aww
Captain
Memory
was
disappointed
Ernie
looked
around
Are
we
safe
here
For
the
moment
the
Captain
shrugged
As
I
said
we
can
t
stay
anywhere
too
long
Waldo
will
zero
in
on
us
if
we
do
Then
what
Ernie
wanted
to
know
I
dunno
the
Captain
mused
I
suppose
he
ll
come
after
us
Ernie
frowned
You
mean
he
ll
come
in
himself
like
personally
Captain
Memory
thought
about
that
Well
I
don
t
suppose
he
ll
come
in
AS
himself
After
all
you
can
be
anyone
or
anyTHING
in
Cyperspace
He
ll
come
in
the
form
of
someone
else
some
famous
person
or
someone
he
d
like
to
be
Like
you
and
your
super
hero
outfit
Sterno
broke
in
Well
yeah
the
Captain
admitted
Ernie
gave
than
some
thought
So
what
form
would
an
evil
genius
want
to
take
Captain
Memory
shrugged
I
dunno
A
Nazi
maybe
He
returned
to
the
TV
Guide
This
is
much
like
my
own
Virtual
Reality
mused
Sterno
He
seemed
to
have
found
a
snifter
of
brandy
somewhere
which
he
swirled
pensively
in
his
left
paw
I
had
a
drawing
room
like
this
I
wrote
poetry
there
Immortal
odes
to
the
glory
of
the
canine
race
Really
Captain
Memory
was
