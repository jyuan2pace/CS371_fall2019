it
that
the
arms
were
scraping
some
of
the
sequins
off
his
suit
Looking
down
he
noticed
that
sequins
had
been
falling
off
his
suit
all
along
leaving
a
sparkly
trail
as
he
walked
Oh
great
he
thought
Now
on
top
of
everything
else
my
suit
is
shedding
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
I
guess
it
must
be
just
about
time
for
the
Eggplant
Uprising
he
commented
The
what
Ernie
was
confused
as
usual
Oh
come
on
The
Captain
was
annoyed
Don
t
you
pay
attention
to
anything
I
tell
you
You
know
the
Revolt
of
the
Vegetables
the
Purple
Menace
remember
when
they
nuked
us
back
to
the
Stone
Age
Oh
sure
Ernie
remembered
being
nuked
well
enough
He
had
some
vague
recollection
of
the
other
stuff
too
He
decided
to
pretend
he
remembered
the
rest
of
it
as
well
since
he
was
tired
of
being
picked
on
for
not
paying
attention
So
uh
what
about
it
Well
anyway
the
Captain
went
on
After
the
Great
Traffic
Jam
The
what
Ernie
broke
in
involuntarily
Oh
you
re
right
said
the
Captain
slightly
abashed
I
didn
t
tell
you
about
that
The
Great
Traffic
Jam
took
place
because
of
this
problem
they
had
due
to
chronic
over
production
of
cars
You
see
they
just
kept
building
all
these
cars
and
people
kept
buying
them
just
for
the
heck
of
it
even
though
they
didn
t
have
anyplace
to
go
in
them
Well
of
course
it
had
to
happen
one
particularly
nice
summer
day
everybody
decided
to
go
for
a
drive
all
at
the
same
time
They
wound
up
bumper
to
bumper
coast
to
coast
The
entire
country
was
tied
up
in
total
gridlock
People
didn
t
know
what
to
do
they
didn
t
know
how
to
get
around
without
their
cars
anymore
It
was
terrible
there
was
mass
starvation
Thousands
died
vultures
picked
their
bones
through
their
convertible
tops
Well
I
m
sure
you
can
see
that
under
circumstances
like
these
people
were
in
no
mood
for
a
practical
joke
Uh
right
Ernie
thought
he
d
just
agree
and
maybe
the
Captain
would
go
on
with
the
story
without
noticing
that
Ernie
wasn
t
following
the
story
at
all
Ernie
was
lucky
The
Captain
continued
Well
you
can
imagine
how
people
felt
when
rumors
began
to
fly
about
certain
species
of
giant
plants
that
had
escaped
from
the
atomic
testing
laboratories
and
had
grown
to
enormous
size
by
feasting
on
human
flesh
And
how
these
plants
were
determined
to
get
revenge
on
the
entire
animal
kingdom
for
the
millions
of
years
of
abuse
they
and
their
plant
brothers
had
had
to
put
up
with
at
the
hands
and
paws
and
muzzles
and
so
on
of
non
vegetable
life
forms
Ernie
furled
his
brow
Does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Vegetable
Rights
Movement
You
got
it
agreed
Captain
Memory
Ernie
felt
a
sinking
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
In
spite
of
himself
he
WAS
beginning
to
remember
all
this
He
didn
t
WANT
to
remember
it
because
if
he
remembered
it
that
meant
Ernie
didn
t
want
to
think
about
what
that
meant
Anyway
the
Captain
continued
They
were
going
to
organize
all
the
vegetables
stage
a
massive
uprising
and
eliminate
all
animal
life
for
ever
On
top
of
all
this
these
plants
were
invulnerable
to
conventional
weapons
and
could
only
be
destroyed
by
the
atomic
fires
that
had
created
them
Small
wonder
then
that
general
panic
broke
out
when
something
very
large
and
very
purple
raised
it
s
leafy
head
over
the
city
of
Chicago
Captain
Memory
chuckled
Oh
wow
said
Ernie
This
was
really
creepy
It
was
a
lot
like
telling
ghost
stories
around
the
campfire
at
camp
So
it
was
a
giant
man
eating
eggplant
Don
t
be
silly
How
could
there
be
a
such
a
thing
as
a
giant
man
eating
eggplant
Captain
Memory
was
amused
No
it
was
just
practical
joke
It
was
that
zany
Andreas
Labyrinth
and
his
band
of
merry
pranksters
up
to
their
little
games
again
Captain
Memory
chortled
I
still
remember
that
phony
Russian
invasion
That
was
really
a
riot
Or
how
about
that
bogus
epidemic
That
had
everybody
in
stitches
Something
about
that
explanation
didn
t
seem
quite
right
to
Ernie
but
he
wasn
t
in
the
mood
to
try
to
figure
out
what
it
was
He
wanted
to
hear
the
rest
of
Captain
Memory
s
story
So
then
what
happened
uh
will
happen
uh
so
what
about
the
Eggplant
Well
as
I
was
saying
Captain
Memory
always
enjoyed
telling
stories
It
wasn
t
really
a
giant
Eggplant
it
was
really
just
a
big
purple
balloon
But
it
looked
a
lot
like
a
giant
eggplant
you
know
big
scary
face
painted
on
it
and
all
I
suppose
in
saner
times
people
might
have
questioned
the
whole
thing
a
little
more
closely
After
all
there
wasn
t
really
any
proof
that
it
was
a
giant
eggplant
It
could
have
been
a
giant
grape
No
reason
to
nuke
a
giant
grape
is
there
I
guess
not
Ernie
supposed
he
might
as
well
agree
since
he
couldn
t
think
of
any
reason
on
Earth
to
nuke
a
giant
grape
But
people
just
didn
t
stop
and
think
the
Captain
went
on
They
just
went
ahead
and
dropped
the
bomb
And
when
they
found
out
boy
were
they
mad
Captain
Memory
chuckled
Of
course
it
isn
t
really
funny
if
it
doesn
t
make
somebody
mad
is
it
That
s
what
practical
jokes
are
all
about
Captain
Memory
paused
But
anyway
all
of
this
should
be
taking
place
just
about
he
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
Now
A
sound
like
that
of
distant
thunder
shook
the
house
Ernie
looked
out
the
window
Chicago
he
asked
Yup
answered
the
Captain
There
it
goes
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Did
they
nuke
Chicago
twice
Why
would
they
want
to
do
something
like
that
Captain
Memory
wondered
Once
you
nuke
it
it
stays
nuked
Well
in
that
case
Ernie
pondered
How
could
we
be
in
Chicago
just
before
it
got
nuked
before
when
we
re
here
just
before
it
got
nuked
now
Captain
Memory
frowned
That
is
confusing
isn
t
it
I
ve
never
quite
figured
that
out
The
Captain
didn
t
seem
overly
upset
about
the
problem
Ernie
decided
that
it
probably
wouldn
t
be
good
for
him
to
think
about
that
problem
anymore
He
decided
to
think
about
something
else
So
what
ever
happened
to
that
practical
joker
that
Andreas
Whats
His
Name
he
asked
As
if
in
answer
to
this
question
a
figure
burst
through
the
door
It
was
an
older
man
with
a
wild
white
beard
and
hair
His
clothes
were
in
tatters
and
he
was
covered
with
splotches
of
egg
rotten
tomatoes
and
other
things
too
disgusting
to
think
about
Hide
me
hide
me
he
implored
They
re
after
me
They
ll
tear
me
to
pieces
It
was
just
a
joke
I
didn
t
know
they
d
take
it
seriously
It
was
just
a
practical
joke
Well
Ernie
began
Suddenly
the
man
seemed
to
see
Ernie
clearly
for
the
first
time
A
BULLFIGHTER
He
looked
at
Captain
Memory
A
comic
book
character
He
looked
at
the
Fly
A
GIANT
FLY
What
IS
your
problem
Sterno
demanded
A
TALKING
DOG
the
man
shrieked
You
re
all
worse
than
me
I
ve
got
to
get
out
of
here
They
ll
tear
you
all
to
pieces
With
that
the
man
threw
himself
through
the
nearest
window
which
luckily
had
been
glazed
with
large
panes
of
sugar
instead
of
glass
He
sprinted
towards
a
group
of
trees
behind
the
house
and
disappeared
into
a
large
hole
beneath
one
of
them
Ernie
thought
he
saw
a
large
white
rabbit
with
a
watch
disappear
into
the
hole
as
well
but
he
wasn
t
sure
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
I
d
really
like
to
get
a
watch
he
commented
It
doesn
t
have
to
be
anything
fancy
A
Timex
would
be
okay
The
Fly
was
looking
out
the
door
Uh
oh
he
said
ominously
Here
they
come
Here
WHO
comes
Ernie
demanded
anxiously
The
angry
villagers
the
Fly
said
unhappily
You
know
with
the
torches
and
the
rocks
and
everything
You
don
t
want
to
mess
with
the
angry
villagers
man
They
re
mean
They
Fly
shuddered
He
seemed
to
have
had
some
kind
of
bad
experience
with
them
in
the
past
Uh
maybe
we
ought
to
get
out
of
here
Ernie
suggested
I
haven
t
finished
my
strawberry
mousse
Sterno
said
petulantly
Oh
man
I
don
t
know
what
we
re
gonna
do
said
the
Fly
miserably
They
re
closing
in
on
us
from
all
sides
Ernie
peered
through
the
broken
window
He
could
see
the
smoke
from
their
torches
in
the
distance
It
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
they
should
barricade
the
door
or
something
Unfortunately
the
door
had
already
been
broken
off
its
hinges
by
the
Nazis
Ernie
put
it
upright
in
the
doorframe
as
best
he
could
and
shoved
a
small
rocking
chair
up
against
it
to
hold
it
I
don
t
think
that
s
gonna
stop
anybody
the
Fly
said
glumly
Ernie
could
hear
angry
shouts
The
villagers
were
approaching
fast
I
think
we
better
do
something
Ernie
urged
Captain
Memory
Oh
yeah
Captain
Memory
looked
up
unconcernedly
Like
what
With
a
crash
a
rock
came
sailing
through
on
of
the
unbroken
windows
The
angry
shouts
were
quite
close
now
Ernie
couldn
t
understand
them
though
They
seemed
to
be
in
German
A
burning
torch
came
sailing
through
an
open
window
Another
landed
just
outside
the
door
Thick
black
smoke
began
to
fill
the
air
Ew
burning
sugar
complained
Sterno
How
rank
The
Fly
peeked
out
a
window
Oh
man
those
angry
villagers
They
re
bad
news
Hey
this
place
is
burning
up
Ernie
urged
Captain
Memory
We
ve
got
to
DO
something
Captain
Memory
made
a
wry
face
Well
I
guess
there
s
no
point
in
hanging
around
HERE
anymore
He
thought
a
moment
Let
s
try
F
D
The
scene
vanished
Blinking
Ernie
found
himself
once
again
in
an
entirely
different
place
He
staggered
and
his
stomach
flip
flopped
Oh
man
he
moaned
I
don
t
know
if
I
can
take
these
sudden
changes
of
scene
anymore
Oh
Captain
Memory
seemed
surprised
Would
you
rather
be
back
at
the
gingerbread
cottage
Ernie
straightened
up
abruptly
No
no
that
s
okay
I
m
fine
just
fine
I
d
just
as
soon
be
right
um
He
looked
around
Captain
Memory
the
Fly
and
Sterno
were
all
looking
around
as
well
They
were
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
large
government
office
It
was
a
big
room
with
a
high
arched
ceiling
lit
by
rows
of
fluorescent
lights
The
walls
were
painted
eye
saver
green
It
looks
like
an
old
fashioned
post
office
or
something
Ernie
thought
In
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
long
row
of
tables
with
forms
in
little
pigeonholes
and
pens
attached
by
chains
A
row
of
windows
occupied
one
wall
each
with
a
bored
looking
clerk
doing
something
with
papers
A
sign
above
the
windows
said
Federal
Bureau
of
Drawers
Ernie
was
puzzled
Why
did
you
bring
us
here
He
asked
Captain
Memory
This
isn
t
quite
what
I
expected
admitted
the
Captain
He
seemed
just
as
puzzled
as
Ernie
Actually
I
didn
t
really
want
to
leave
I
really
wanted
to
have
another
piece
of
cake
German
chocolate
as
a
matter
of
fact
He
sighed
I
guess
I
won
t
get
my
cake
now
Ernie
sighed
as
well
He
wished
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
eat
something
while
they
were
still
at
the
cottage
He
was
beginning
to
get
really
hungry
and
it
didn
t
look
like
he
was
going
to
be
able
to
find
anything
to
eat
here
Ernie
looked
around
What
is
this
place
The
Captain
regarded
the
building
thoughfully
I
m
not
sure
but
I
think
it
s
a
database
A
database
Ernie
was
confused
I
thought
data
in
Cyberspace
was
supposed
to
look
like
big
glowing
geometric
forms
that
you
could
fly
around
in
Yeah
well
you
could
do
that
if
you
wanted
the
Captain
explained
But
businesses
usually
don
t
They
secretaries
don
t
like
em
They
like
something
a
little
more
you
know
traditional
Like
this
He
gestured
at
the
building
around
them
Their
discussion
was
interrupted
by
a
shrill
nasal
voice
Next
please
Ernie
looked
around
confusedly
That
s
you
An
unpleasant
looking
older
woman
with
her
hair
pulled
back
in
a
tight
bun
seemed
to
be
pointing
at
him
Step
up
to
the
window
please
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
What
should
we
do
The
Captain
shrugged
I
guess
we
should
step
up
to
the
window
They
did
so
Hello
Captain
Memory
said
pleasantly
to
the
woman
behind
the
window
Can
you
tell
us
why
we
re
here
Certainly
she
said
through
tight
lips
Captain
Memory
smiled
See
he
said
to
Ernie
This
isn
t
going
to
be
hard
at
all
The
woman
behind
the
window
smirked
unpleasantly
Just
fill
out
this
form
She
handed
a
thick
sheaf
of
papers
to
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
s
face
fell
What
s
this
for
The
woman
smirked
happily
That
s
a
form
Request
for
Information
I
assume
you
have
your
authorized
Form
with
you
Uh
I
don
t
think
so
the
Captain
answered
confusedly
What
is
it
Oh
you
must
have
your
Form
Request
for
Request
for
Information
completely
filled
out
authorized
and
validated
before
we
can
process
your
Form
Request
for
Information
Oh
you
don
t
have
a
Form
Here
you
are
The
woman
handed
Captain
Memory
another
thick
sheaf
of
papers
Captain
Memory
looked
very
unhappy
He
leafed
though
the
forms
These
are
real
long
he
complained
Be
sure
to
read
ALL
the
directions
the
woman
simpered
cheerfully
Her
mood
seemed
to
be
improving
with
every
passing
form
And
fill
in
all
the
blanks
except
those
marked
Do
Not
Fill
In
This
Blank
Of
course
if
you
fail
to
fill
in
any
of
the
correct
blanks
or
if
you
should
happen
to
fill
in
any
blank
marked
Do
Not
Fill
In
This
Blank
then
you
ll
have
to
start
ALL
over
again
She
cackled
with
glee
at
the
thought
And
of
course
you
ll
need
a
Form
Request
for
Authorization
of
Forms
a
Form
Request
for
Validation
of
Forms
a
Form
b
Request
for
Instructions
for
Authorization
and
Validation
of
Forms
and
a
Form
A
Application
for
Verification
of
Authorization
and
Validation
She
handed
Captain
Memory
four
more
thick
forms
He
now
had
a
pile
of
forms
about
eight
inches
high
in
front
of
him
And
of
course
she
said
to
Ernie
We
ll
need
a
complete
set
of
forms
from
you
as
well
she
handed
Ernie
a
similar
stack
of
papers
And
from
you
and
from
you
She
handed
the
Fly
and
Sterno
each
their
own
stack
The
woman
seemed
positively
ecstatic
now
Ernie
looked
at
the
pile
in
shock
There
s
there
s
thousands
of
them
Oh
yes
said
the
woman
gleefully
There
used
to
be
only
hundreds
but
ever
since
they
passed
the
Paperwork
Reduction
Act
we
ve
had
far
more
Ernie
regarded
the
papers
with
dismay
After
you
ve
filled
all
those
out
the
woman
continued
delightedly
We
ll
start
on
the
rest
The
foursome
took
their
piles
of
forms
to
the
tables
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
began
leafing
through
them
despondently
These
government
offices
are
always
so
depressing
Sterno
complained
Why
must
they
always
paint
them
that
ghastly
shade
of
green
Ernie
decided
that
he
agreed
with
Sterno
but
he
was
too
depressed
to
talk
He
began
leafing
listlessly
through
his
Form
Application
for
Verification
of
Authorization
and
Validation
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
happened
to
be
at
the
top
of
the
pile
It
started
out
straightforwardly
enough
Name
Social
Security
Father
s
Name
Mother
s
Name
Mother
s
Maiden
Name
DO
NOT
WRITE
IN
THIS
SPACE
Grandfather
s
Name
Grandmother
s
Name
Ernie
tried
to
fill
in
his
name
but
the
pen
on
the
little
chain
wouldn
t
write
Instead
he
flipped

Ernie
looked
up
Do
you
get
the
feeling
they
re
playing
games
with
us
he
asked
the
others
Oh
NO
cried
the
Fly
desperately
What
said
Ernie
alarmed
I
wrote
in

that
says

wailed
the
Fly
Tsk

said
Sterno
You
re
in
big
trouble
now
Ernie
was
glad
that
it
was
someone
other
than
himself
who
was
in
big
trouble
for
a
change
He
looked
over
at
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
was
having
a
hard
time
filling
out
his
forms
He
seemed
to
have
gotten
stuck
Ernie
looked
over
his
shoulder
As
a
matter
of
fact
the
Captain
seemed
to
have
gotten
stuck
on
the
first
space
NAME
Should
I
put
Captain
Memory
or
Memory
Captain
he
mused
Ernie
noticed
that
the
Captain
s
form
was
different
from
his
Ernie
read

I
know
said
Captain
Memory
I
can
put
Memory
under
Name
and
Captain
under
Rank
I
wonder
what
I
should
put
under
Cereal
Number
Ernie
suddenly
became
very
uneasy
I
think
maybe
we
should
just
get
out
of
here
while
we
have
the
chance
Sterno
was
leafing
through
his
pile
of
papers
Aha
he
cried
Here
we
go
Form
Request
for
Authorization
to
Apply
for
a
License
to
Purchase
Cigars
Now
we
re
getting
somewhere
Sterno
did
not
find
the
forms
upsetting
at
all
In
fact
he
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
able
to
deal
with
them
He
began
scribbling
industriously
in
the
blanks
As
Ernie
watched
he
took
his
sheaf
of
forms
to
one
of
the
windows
where
it
was
stamped
He
then
took
it
to
another
window
where
a
large
gold
seal
was
affixed
to
it
Then
on
to
another
window
where
several
people
signed
it
He
then
disappeared
around
a
corner
and
returned
moments
later
carrying
a
large
box
of
cigars
Wow
The
Fly
was
awestruck
That
s
amazing
I
wonder
how
he
does
that
It
s
not
really
that
difficult
commented
Sterno
lighting
up
a
big
cigar
His
disposition
always
improved
tremendously
when
he
had
a
cigar
I
ll
tell
you
a
secret
the
universe
is
actually
a
giant
bureaucracy
It
s
possible
to
get
anything
in
the
Cosmos
done
if
you
fill
out
the
right
forms
However
filling
out
the
right
forms
can
sometimes
be
very
difficult
indeed
He
puffed
his
cigar
appreciatively
Havanas
no
less
One
needs
a
special
permit
to
get
these
I
ll
have
you
know
The
Fly
meanwhile
was
intent
on
trying
to
erase
what
he
had
written
in
the
space
marked
Do
Not
Write
in
This
Space
So
far
he
had
only
succeeded
in
tearing
a
hole
in
the
paper
Ernie
meanwhile
was
noticing
the
fact
that
all
the
clerks
and
tellers
seemed
to
be
watching
them
Another
unusual
thing
struck
him
Hey
guys
he
commented
Did
you
notice
that
there
s
all
these
clerks
and
all
these
officials
but
no
customers
besides
us
Egad
that
IS
odd
agreed
Sterno
Everyone
knows
that
the
usual
ratio
is
customers
per
clerk
He
looked
around
Where
ARE
all
the
lines
I
ve
never
seen
a
government
office
this
empty
except
of
course
at
the
Administration
for
Not
Doing
Anything
At
