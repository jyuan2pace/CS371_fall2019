purposefully
towards
a
ridge
of
white
cliffs
in
the
distance
He
seemed
not
to
hear
Ernie
or
if
he
did
he
paid
no
attention
Ernie
hurried
to
catch
up
At
least
you
re
properly
dressed
for
the
occasion
Sterno
commented
to
Ernie
I
understand
fur
loincloths
are
all
the
rage
this
year
Sterno
snickered
Ernie
looked
down
at
his
garment
He
had
been
wearing
it
so
long
he
had
sort
of
forgotten
about
it
If
we
run
into
any
saber
tooth
tigers
Sterno
continued
You
can
just
chop
them
up
with
your
plastic
broadsword
Sterno
laughed
unpleasantly
Are
you
still
carrying
that
thing
Captain
Memory
called
without
looking
back
Hey
it
s
a
forty
buck
deposit
okay
Ernie
sensed
that
they
were
both
laughing
at
him
Gimme
a
break
huh
Hopeless
just
hopeless
Sterno
muttered
amused
Ernie
began
to
be
able
to
make
out
an
odd
looking
object
in
the
distance
It
seemed
to
be
some
sort
of
primitive
building
As
they
approached
Ernie
began
to
see
it
more
clearly
It
seemed
to
be
a
house
made
out
of
huge
slabs
of
stone
Holes
were
cut
in
the
front
slab
for
windows
and
a
door
A
huge
flat
slab
made
up
the
roof
Sitting
outside
the
house
was
a
very
odd
object
It
was
a
wooden
framework
connected
to
two
huge
stone
rollers
There
was
a
seat
on
the
framework
and
a
piece
of
fur
held
up
above
the
seat
creating
a
primitive
roof
How
odd
commented
Sterno
Some
sort
of
totem
object
no
doubt
Perhaps
a
throne
of
some
sort
They
approached
the
house
It
began
to
look
a
bit
familiar
to
Ernie
Those
fur
curtains
on
the
windows
where
had
he
seen
those
before
A
neat
walk
led
toward
the
front
door
At
the
end
of
the
walk
was
a
stone
box
held
up
on
a
pole
There
was
something
written
on
the
box
The
name
confirmed
Ernie
s
worst
fears
F
FLINTSTONE
Hey
guys
Ernie
called
out
Hmm
returned
Captain
Memory
continuing
to
walk
toward
the
house
He
was
as
usual
not
paying
much
attention
to
Ernie
Um
I
don
t
think
we
should
go
in
there
Why
not
Captain
Memory
did
not
even
slow
down
I
ve
got
a
real
bad
feeling
about
this
place
Aww
is
the
big
strong
barbarian
afraid
of
the
little
house
sneered
Sterno
Well
then
he
can
just
stay
out
here
with
the
saber
tooth
tigers
if
he
likes
The
two
of
them
continued
into
the
house
leaving
Ernie
standing
alone
on
the
front
walk
Ernie
looked
around
The
sun
was
slowly
edging
towards
the
horizon
casting
long
menacing
looking
shadows
Ernie
found
himself
anxiously
looking
around
for
places
large
enough
for
a
saber
tooth
tiger
to
hide
in
Well
he
thought
There
s
not
much
point
in
standing
here
I
might
as
well
go
in
Stepping
inside
the
doorway
Ernie
found
himself
in
a
living
room
appointed
with
furniture
made
of
stone
and
wood
Captain
Memory
and
Sterno
had
made
themselves
comfortable
on
the
stone
and
fur
sofa
The
owners
of
the
house
were
nowhere
in
sight
Rather
luxurious
for
the
Stone
Age
don
t
you
think
commented
Sterno
Captain
Memory
was
once
again
engrossed
in
his
copy
of
the
TV
Guide
Ernie
noticed
across
from
the
sofa
what
appeared
to
be
a
roughly
carved
stone
television
set
He
moaned
Whatever
is
the
matter
said
Sterno
impatiently
Hey
guys
Ernie
implored
I
really
think
we
ought
to
get
out
of
here
I
think
this
is
some
kind
of
a
trap
or
something
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
Paranoia
he
commented
The
poor
creature
would
like
to
think
he
s
important
enough
for
anyone
to
bother
persecuting
He
turned
to
Ernie
Who
in
the
world
would
want
to
lay
a
trap
for
you
What
possible
use
could
they
have
for
you
if
they
caught
you
Ernie
shifted
back
and
forth
uncomfortably
Suddenly
an
object
caught
his
eye
Paranoia
huh
he
demanded
What
about
THAT
He
pointed
to
an
object
in
a
dark
corner
Ernie
s
exclamation
was
enough
to
tear
Captain
Memory
s
attention
away
from
his
TV
Guide
He
peered
at
the
object
It
was
a
box
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
lens
attached
to
it
As
they
looked
at
it
it
whirred
quietly
moving
the
lens
back
and
forth
It
s
a
hidden
camera
Ernie
cried
triumphantly
We
re
being
watched
Sterno
was
nonplussed
Where
did
that
come
from
Well
tear
it
out
then
Captain
Memory
said
Ernie
strode
over
to
the
dark
corner
grabbed
to
camera
and
yanked
it
out
of
it
s
mounting
He
dashed
it
to
the
ground
where
it
shattered
revealing
feebly
glowing
electronic
parts
which
slowly
one
by
one
went
out
Well
so
much
for
that
Captain
Memory
returned
to
the
TV
Guide
Is
that
ALL
exclaimed
Ernie
Well
what
else
did
you
want
asked
Captain
Memory
mystified
Look
I
just
proved
to
you
that
this
is
some
kind
of
a
trap
or
something
cried
Ernie
exasperatedly
There
was
a
hidden
camera
watching
us
for
heaven
s
sake
So
you
took
it
out
Captain
Memory
seemed
perfectly
satisfied
So
much
for
that
Ernie
was
getting
very
frustrated
Well
well
what
if
there
s
another
Oh
I
very
much
doubt
that
Sterno
commented
Captain
Memory
was
still
studying
his
TV
Guide
Wanna
watch
some
TV
he
asked
brightly
NO
Ernie
was
building
up
a
real
aversion
to
television
Why
not
Captain
Memory
couldn
t
imagine
why
anyone
would
not
want
to
watch
TV
Look
said
Ernie
desperately
This
is
the
Stone
Age
right
There
aren
t
supposed
to
be
any
TVs
here
They
haven
t
been
invented
yet
This
is
before
television
Captain
Memory
chuckled
Don
t
be
silly
No
time
is
before
television
He
got
up
and
walked
over
to
the
set
How
primitive
Sterno
commented
No
remote
control
That
s
only
to
be
expected
in
the
Stone
Age
I
suppose
Look
said
Ernie
urgently
I
m
positive
there
were
no
televisions
in
the
Stone
Age
Captain
Memory
sighed
Be
reasonable
he
said
have
you
ever
seen
oh
let
s
say
I
Was
a
Teenage
Caveman
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Um
yes
Where
did
you
see
it
On
TV
It
takes
place
in
the
Stone
Age
right
Um
yeah
Ernie
wasn
t
sure
he
liked
the
way
this
line
of
questioning
was
going
Well
how
could
that
be
UNLESS
THERE
WERE
TELEVISIONS
IN
THE
STONE
AGE
Captain
Memory
cried
triumphantly
I
rest
my
case
Sterno
applauded
Bravo
he
said
politely
Well
well
Ernie
was
sure
there
was
something
wrong
with
this
argument
but
he
couldn
t
quite
figure
out
what
it
was
He
noticed
that
no
one
was
listening
to
him
anyway
Captain
Memory
switched
on
the
television
Being
a
primitive
set
it
took
a
long
time
to
warm
up
A
picture
of
a
room
very
much
like
the
one
the
three
were
in
appeared
on
the
television
screen
taken
from
an
odd
angle
Eww
black
and
white
sniffed
Sterno
This
really
is
the
Stone
Age
isn
t
it
Ernie
stared
at
the
picture
A
man
in
a
comic
book
character
outfit
accompanied
by
a
dog
entered
the
room
and
they
both
sat
down
After
a
short
wait
another
figure
clad
in
a
fur
loincloth
and
carrying
a
large
plastic
broadsword
also
entered
The
characters
seemed
to
be
conversing
but
their
voices
were
too
indistinct
to
understand
I
can
t
hear
what
they
re
saying
Captain
Memory
said
Seems
to
be
a
sound
problem
Sterno
sniffed
Only
to
be
expected
from
prehistoric
TV
stations
Suddenly
one
of
the
characters
pointed
directly
at
them
hidden
camera
They
heard
the
figure
say
We
re
being
watched
The
other
characters
said
something
indistinct
The
figure
in
the
loincloth
loomed
larger
and
larger
in
the
picture
until
finally
the
screen
was
entirely
taken
up
by
a
face
not
unlike
Ernie
s
own
A
huge
hand
loomed
up
over
the
screen
and
the
picture
went
dead
Ernie
looked
at
the
dead
television
screen
I
don
t
like
the
looks
of
this
at
all
he
said
warily
Neither
do
I
agreed
Captain
Memory
Let
s
watch
something
else
He
changed
the
channel
A
different
scene
appeared
In
it
two
men
were
seated
at
a
large
array
of
electronic
equipment
their
backs
to
the
audience
They
were
peering
intently
at
their
devices
and
conversing
Looks
like
they
found
the
hidden
camera
one
said
to
the
other
What
are
we
gonna
do
Let
s
switch
over
to
the
second
camera
What
if
they
find
that
one
They
won
t
They
don
t
suspect
a
thing
The
two
men
flipped
some
switches
Here
we
go
said
the
first
Wanna
see
it
Sure
The
man
flipped
a
switch
Suddenly
the
scene
changed
back
to
the
room
suspiciously
like
their
own
The
figure
in
the
loincloth
appeared
upset
Hey
cried
Ernie
Hey
cried
the
loincloth
clad
figure
on
the
television
That
s
us
That
s
us
echoed
his
TV
image
Captain
Memory
regarded
the
television
picture
Not
a
very
interesting
show
he
commented
echoed
a
moment
later
by
the
comic
book
clad
character
on
the
television
Seems
a
bit
repetitious
Might
as
well
turn
it
off
Wait
Ernie
cried
but
it
was
too
late
Captain
Memory
had
already
shut
off
the
set
Captain
Memory
was
confused
Wait
I
thought
you
didn
t
want
to
watch
TV
I
just
turned
it
off
to
be
nice
I
can
turn
it
back
on
if
you
want
He
reached
toward
the
set
NO
No
uh
that
s
okay
Uh
thanks
I
d
just
as
soon
we
didn
t
watch
anything
right
now
if
you
don
t
mind
Ernie
was
not
prepared
for
the
possible
consequences
of
turning
on
the
TV
again
He
had
more
than
enough
to
deal
with
as
it
was
Ernie
gathered
up
his
thoughts
Okay
guys
look
I
gotta
tell
you
something
This
place
is
not
what
it
seems
Really
Captain
Memory
had
returned
to
the
study
of
his
favorite
reading
matter
the
TV
Guide
Ernie
continued
This
isn
t
a
typical
Stone
Age
house
okay
It
s
actually
a
set
from
a
s
cartoon
series
called
The
Flintstones
Oh
we
know
THAT
Captain
Memory
commented
not
bothering
to
look
up
You
DO
Ernie
was
upset
Well
well
why
didn
t
you
SAY
something
You
didn
t
ask
Sterno
was
considering
something
Ernie
had
said
a
few
moments
earlier
What
makes
you
think
The
Flintstones
isn
t
typical
of
the
Stone
Age
Ernie
dropped
into
a
chair
This
was
getting
to
be
to
much
for
him
he
thought
The
more
he
argued
about
all
of
this
the
more
he
seemed
to
be
losing
ground
He
wasn
t
even
sure
what
point
he
was
losing
ground
on
Ernie
decided
to
try
another
approach
Okay
I
give
up
You
tell
me
then
What
is
going
on
Oh
you
want
to
know
what
s
going
on
said
the
Captain
brightly
He
always
enjoyed
telling
stories
Why
didn
t
you
say
so
Well
he
went
on
warming
up
to
his
subject
All
of
this
is
totally
artificial
It
was
put
here
to
be
a
trap
That
s
what
I
was
trying
to
tell
you
cried
Ernie
excitedly
It
s
a
trap
I
knew
it
Captain
Memory
was
annoyed
Do
you
want
to
hear
this
or
do
you
want
to
talk
Sorry
Ernie
shut
up
Where
was
I
Captain
Memory
gathered
his
thoughts
Oh
yes
Anyway
this
is
part
of
a
game
called
THE
FLINTSTONES
in
which
Fred
and
Barney
thwart
an
attempt
by
aliens
to
take
over
the
Earth
back
in
the
Stone
Age
It
s
really
quite
elaborate
An
excellent
game
Sterno
added
I
ve
played
it
myself
Anyway
Captain
Memory
continued
This
house
is
actually
a
trap
set
by
the
aliens
to
try
to
capture
Earth
people
We
knew
that
but
we
thought
we
d
come
in
here
anyway
because
it
s
more
comfortable
than
a
cave
don
t
you
think
Aha
cried
Sterno
What
Ernie
was
startled
Cigars
Sterno
had
found
a
stone
jar
and
opened
it
He
pulled
out
a
cigar
and
examined
it
sniffing
it
carefully
They
re
not
very
good
but
I
suppose
they
ll
have
to
do
One
must
after
all
make
allowances
in
the
Stone
Age
He
lit
one
puffing
little
clouds
of
blue
smoke
into
the
air
Captain
Memory
returned
to
the
TV
Guide
So
what
about
these
aliens
Ernie
inquired
What
do
they
want
Oh
I
don
t
know
Typical
alien
stuff
I
imagine
Take
me
to
your
leader
conquer
the
world
steal
your
brain
You
know
all
that
stuff
aliens
always
do
Ernie
was
mystified
But
why
Oh
I
don
t
know
Probably
from
watching
old
science
fiction
movies
on
TV
The
aliens
seem
to
think
that
sort
of
thing
is
expected
of
them
Ernie
wasn
t
following
this
Watching
TV
Aliens
watch
TV
Of
course
Captain
Memory
went
on
You
d
have
to
expect
something
like
that
to
happen
After
all
we
ve
been
beaming
those
radio
and
television
waves
out
into
outer
space
for
years
It
was
only
a
matter
of
time
until
someone
picked
them
up
Do
you
realize
that
there
are
civilizations
forty
light
years
from
here
that
are
now
watching
s
situation
comedies
What
do
you
suppose
they
think
of
that
Well
Ernie
began
Did
you
ever
think
that
they
might
consider
it
a
hostile
act
Captain
Memory
continued
animatedly
They
might
think
having
I
Love
Lucy
reruns
beamed
at
them
is
an
act
of
war
Huh
Ernie
wasn
t
following
this
too
well
Well
look
at
it
from
their
point
of
view
Captain
Memory
explained
Here
they
are
they
come
home
from
a
hard
day
at
well
whatever
it
is
they
do
they
just
wanna
watch
a
little
TV
you
know
So
they
flip
on
their
set
and
what
do
they
get
Mr
Ed
The
Flintstones
I
Love
Lucy
They
don
t
wanna
watch
this
They
wanna
watch
you
know
ALIEN
shows
Ernie
considered
this
I
Love
Lucy
huh
Well
I
can
see
their
point
So
maybe
they
decide
to
flip
on
the
stereo
Captain
Memory
continued
And
what
do
they
get
The
Chiffons
the
Ronettes
Chuck
Berry
Maybe
they
don
t
like
rock
n
roll
Did
you
ever
think
of
that
No
Ernie
was
amazed
I
thought
everybody
liked
rock
n
roll
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
You
can
t
take
anything
for
granted
in
Outer
Space
Ernie
found
this
disturbing
Maybe
it
wasn
t
such
a
good
idea
to
let
all
those
TV
waves
get
out
into
space
then
Probably
not
agreed
Captain
Memory
But
it
s
too
late
now
We
ll
just
have
to
deal
with
the
consequences
Ernie
didn
t
like
that
word
consequences
He
would
rather
not
think
about
what
the
consequences
of
all
of
this
might
be
He
rubbed
his
head
He
especially
didn
t
like
that
steal
your
brain
business
So
what
are
we
gonna
do
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Do
repeated
Captain
Memory
distantly
He
had
returned
to
reading
Ernie
heard
a
shout
far
in
the
distance
He
strained
his
ears
There
it
was
again
It
sounded
like
Yabba
dabba
doo
Look
I
think
we
ought
to
get
out
of
here
Ernie
pleaded
I
think
something
bad
is
gonna
happen
if
we
don
t
leave
like
right
now
Oh
my
What
a
coincidence
cried
Captain
Memory
What
now
Ernie
asked
uneasily
You
ll
never
guess
what
s
on
And
here
we
were
talking
about
almost
that
very
thing
just
a
moment
ago
Ernie
had
a
bad
feeling
about
this
Not
That
s
right
returned
Captain
Memory
jovially
TRUTH
OR
CONSEQUENCES
I
really
don
t
wanna
watch
But
it
was
too
late
Captain
Memory
had
already
flipped
on
the
set
The
set
came
on
and
here
s
our
host
the
announcer
was
saying
That
fabulous
Frenchman
Henri
Gruyere
This
isn
t
the
Truth
or
Consequences
I
remember
said
Ernie
suspiciously
As
usual
no
one
was
listening
Gut
efening
ladies
und
gentlemen
the
host
was
saying
He
was
an
unpleasant
looking
man
wearing
a
traditional
French
outfit
red
striped
shirt
scarf
beret
The
only
things
that
seemed
a
bit
out
of
place
were
his
monocle
and
jackboots
First
of
all
he
continued
I
vould
like
to
point
out
dot
I
am
French
I
am
not
German
Not
at
all
Not
efen
a
little
bit
Wait
a
minute
said
Sterno
suspiciously
Something
smells
here
Hmm
Captain
Memory
looked
up
unconcernedly
Think
about
it
cried
Sterno
Don
t
you
realize
His
name
Gruyere
It
s
CHEESE
But
it
was
as
usual
too
late
Sudden
brightness
dazzled
Ernie
s
eyes
As
his
vision
cleared
he
found
himself
standing
on
a
game
show
stage
with
Captain
Memory
and
Sterno
beside
him
He
blinked
and
staggered
disoriented
by
the
sudden
change
of
scene
He
moaned
and
held
his
head
until
the
sickening
swimming
sensation
stopped
Ernie
looked
up
He
was
facing
the
audience
He
noticed
something
odd
about
the
people
watching
Oh
that
s
it
he
thought
They
re
all
wearing
Nazi
uniforms
I
thought
you
said
this
couldn
t
happen
he
said
to
Captain
Memory
accusingly
I
thought
you
said
there
was
a
million
to
one
chance
of
us
getting
sucked
in
through
a
TV
again
Captain
memory
shrugged
So
I
was
wrong
he
admitted
So
sue
me
The
game
shoe
host
turned
to
the
threesome
Perhaps
you
vould
like
to
step
through
door
number
three
the
host
said
to
them
Ernie
turned
around
A
number
of
very
nice
prizes
were
displayed
on
the
stage
a
red
sports
car
furniture
some
shiny
new
appliances
Several
very
attractive
women
in
cut
down
outfits
were
standing
around
the
stage
Unfortunately
they
all
carried
guns
which
they
held
trained
on
Ernie
and
the
others
Captain
Memory
was
replying
to
the
talk
show
host
No
I
don
t
think
we
would
care
to
step
through
door
number
three
Thanks
just
the
same
The
talk
show
host
laughed
unpleasantly
I
vould
strongly
recommend
dot
you
step
through
door
number
three
he
said
urgently
No
we
d
really
rather
not
answered
the
Captain
pleasantly
The
host
s
face
darkened
You
vill
shtep
through
dat
door
NOW
The
women
s
fingers
tightened
menacingly
on
their
triggers
Oh
well
if
you
put
it
that
way
the
three
of
them
found
themselves
prodded
towards
door
number
three
The
door
opened
in
front
of
them
and
they
found
themselves
thrust
into
blackness
The
door
slammed
behind
them
with
a
resounding
crash
Ernie
blinked
As
his
eyes
began
to
adjust
he
could
see
that
the
room
they
were
in
was
not
entirely
dark
A
small
amount
of
light
came
in
from
a
barred
window
high
up
on
the
opposite
wall
They
were
in
a
large
chamber
with
damp
stone
walls
and
a
dirt
floor
It
seemed
to
be
a
dungeon
Oh
great
Ernie
muttered
So
this
is
what
s
behind
door
number
three
It
could
ve
been
worse
said
Captain
Memory
jovially
Oh
yeah
Ernie
returned
glumly
How
It
could
ve
been
door
number
four
So
What
s
the
big
deal
about
door
number
four
Oh
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
You
don
t
ever
want
to
go
behind
door
number
four
Ernie
didn
t
like
the
sound
of
that
So
what
is
it
It
s
the
worst
Captain
Memory
went
on
ominously
I
mean
it
s
just
too
horrible
A
voice
came
from
out
of
the
darkness
Hi
guys
Ernie
was
taken
aback
It
hadn
t
occurred
to
him
that
someone
else
might
be
in
the
dungeon
with
them
A
figure
approached
from
out
of
the
darkness
Ernie
gasped
It
was
a
horrendous
creature
with
the
body
of
a
human
but
the
tremendously
enlarged
head
of
a
fly
complete
with
huge
faceted
eyes
antennae
and
a
long
trunk
like
snout
It
was
wearing
rather
a
nice
designer
suit
Say
the
creature
continued
Have
any
of
you
guys
seen
my
date
Ernie
stared
soundlessly
Captain
Memory
shrugged
Sorry
The
creature
sighed
She
seemed
like
such
a
nice
girl
too
The
creature
shuffled
back
and
forth
scuffing
his
expensive
designer
shoes
in
the
dirt
Ernie
peered
at
the
creature
He
didn
t
seem
to
be
menacing
at
all
Quite
the
contrary
In
fact
he
seemed
quite
unhappy
But
then
again
Ernie
thought
it
s
kind
of
hard
to
read
expressions
on
a
fly
Aww
that
s
okay
guys
the
Fly
said
sadly
You
don
t
have
to
tell
me
I
can
figure
it
out
She
took
off
right
He
sighed
Just
like
all
the
others
Poor
guy
Ernie
thought
His
date
stood
him
up
Ernie
could
sympathize
he
d
been
in
situations
like
that
himself
Of
course
this
guy
did
have
an
unusual
problem
I
know
the
Fly
continued
It
s
my
looks
right
His
antennae
drooped
sadly
One
little
accident
and
there
goes
your
whole
social
life
Ernie
felt
awkward
What
was
he
expected
to
say
in
a
situation
like
this
Nothing
apparently
for
the
Fly
went
on
I
mean
I
ve
got
a
nice
personality
