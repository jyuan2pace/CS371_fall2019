be
done
Ralph
Ralph
sighed
Oh
okay
He
reached
under
the
seat
and
pulled
out
what
appeared
to
be
a
car
phone
He
picked
up
the
handset
and
dialed
looking
very
glum
Hi
Stella
it
s
Ralph
Ernie
could
only
hear
Ralph
s
side
of
the
conversation
Ralph
seemed
upset
Look
Stella
don
t
start
up
with
me
okay
I
m
having
a
bad
day
okay
Look
it
wasn
t
my
fault
Anyway
I
gotta
talk
to
the
boss
is
he
Oh
no
Stella
don
t
put
me
on
Suddenly
Ralph
froze
into
immobility
Ernie
peered
at
him
Ralph
was
absolutely
motionless
like
a
statue
He
didn
t
even
seem
to
be
breathing
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
What
happened
to
Ralph
Captain
Memory
seemed
unconcerned
Oh
they
put
him
on
hold
On
Hold
Ernie
was
uncomprehending
Captain
Memory
shrugged
Well
you
know
they
always
do
that
when
you
want
to
talk
to
the
boss
You
can
t
expect
him
to
drop
everything
just
to
talk
to
YOU
can
you
The
Captain
chuckled
at
the
thought
Ernie
peered
at
Ralph
He
s
not
breathing
No
he
doesn
t
need
to
He
s
in
suspended
animation
the
Captain
explained
yawning
and
stretching
That
way
you
re
not
aware
of
how
much
time
has
passed
while
you
re
waiting
for
your
connection
Ernie
frowned
I
don
t
think
I
d
like
that
Captain
Memory
shrugged
I
guess
they
feel
it
s
kinder
that
way
he
conjectured
Kinder
Ernie
was
having
a
hard
time
with
all
of
this
It
s
either
that
or
Muzak
Sterno
explained
Oh
Ernie
considered
this
Yeah
I
guess
suspended
animation
would
be
better
He
looked
over
at
Ralph
So
how
long
is
he
gonna
be
like
that
Let
me
see
Captain
Memory
examined
his
bare
wrist
closely
It
s
ten
o
clock
now
so
I
d
say
oh
about
two
billion
years
Two
billion
years
Ernie
was
aghast
Look
at
the
bright
side
Captain
Memory
went
on
cheerfully
By
then
the
parts
store
will
be
open
Ernie
moaned
What
are
we
supposed
to
do
in
the
meantime
Captain
Memory
frowned
Good
point
We
can
t
very
well
sit
around
here
can
we
He
chuckled
Might
as
well
hit
the
road
He
opened
the
car
door
and
flipped
himself
neatly
around
from
his
current
sitting
position
which
was
of
course
upside
down
relative
to
the
others
and
landed
neatly
on
his
feet
on
the
ground
outside
He
turned
to
Ernie
Coming
Ernie
crawled
painfully
out
through
the
open
car
door
and
struggled
to
his
feet
on
the
ground
outside
The
group
assembled
themselves
outside
the
upside
down
taxi
all
of
them
stretching
and
yawning
Ernie
peered
into
the
interior
of
the
taxi
until
he
spotted
his
coffee
maker
which
he
carefully
retrieved
He
stood
up
beside
the
taxi
and
looked
about
confusedly
Sterno
seemed
to
have
regained
his
composure
more
quickly
than
the
other
members
of
the
group
What
is
this
Office
that
you
and
Ralph
were
talking
about
he
asked
Captain
Memory
pointedly
The
Captain
looked
suddenly
uncomfortable
Well
uh
you
know
everybody
s
got
to
work
for
a
living
He
trailed
off
You
mean
you
re
not
a
full
time
Super
Hero
the
Fly
inquired
He
seemed
disappointed
Captain
Memory
shuffled
awkwardly
Well
uh
you
know
Super
Hero
ing
doesn
t
pay
too
good
What
exactly
do
you
do
at
this
Office
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Oh
you
know
a
little
programming
The
Captain
seemed
evasive
Oh
said
Sterno
with
relish
This
is
beginning
to
make
a
lot
more
sense
to
me
now
THAT
S
how
you
manage
to
do
all
these
tricky
things
here
in
Cyberspace
You
re
using
the
Company
computer
You
ve
got
a
mainframe
to
work
with
don
t
you
Well
Captain
Memory
seemed
very
uncomfortable
Sterno
continued
I
bet
you
re
not
running
all
this
from
a
PC
Well
no
the
Captain
admitted
I
got
a
Cray
A
CRAY
Even
Ernie
who
knew
very
little
about
computers
had
heard
of
the
awesome
power
of
a
Cray
Well
it
s
not
mine
personally
you
understand
the
Captain
began
defensively
In
other
words
Sterno
said
reflectively
You
re
using
the
Company
s
Cray
to
break
into
Waldo
Stadium
s
stolen
systems
and
free
the
Cyberslaves
Sterno
s
eyes
narrowed
Aren
t
you
supposed
to
be
doing
something
more
productive
Hey
this
is
important
Captain
Memory
insisted
indignantly
Anyway
it
s
part
of
R
D
you
know
After
all
I
could
He
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
thunderous
BOOM
BOOM
BOOM
of
jungle
drums
A
distant
chanting
reached
their
ears
Ernie
struggled
to
make
it
out
It
seemed
to
be
something
like
Oom
alla
boom
YUM
YUM
YUM
Maybe
we
should
um
get
moving
Ernie
suggested
Uh
sure
The
Captain
agreed
glad
to
change
the
subject
Let
s
go
He
began
striding
purposefully
forward
He
walked
right
up
to
an
impenetrable
thicket
and
stopped
looking
at
it
confusedly
How
about
this
trail
Ernie
suggested
pointing
to
a
narrow
path
that
led
through
the
underbrush
in
the
opposite
direction
from
the
trail
they
had
come
in
on
It
was
also
luckily
leading
the
opposite
direction
from
the
jungle
drums
Captain
Memory
snapped
his
fingers
Of
course
That
s
it
A
trail
We
need
a
trail
Now
why
didn
t
I
think
of
that
Good
question
Sterno
agreed
Captain
Memory
headed
purposefully
down
the
trail
the
others
following
behind
him
Within
seconds
the
forest
seemed
to
close
in
around
them
Ernie
could
see
nothing
around
him
but
dense
underbrush
All
he
could
see
ahead
of
him
was
Captain
Memory
s
back
He
supposed
that
he
didn
t
have
much
alternative
except
to
just
keep
moving
along
the
trail
At
least
the
sound
of
the
jungle
drums
was
diminishing
Ernie
began
to
be
aware
of
a
sound
in
the
distance
A
sort
of
whooshing
sound
It
sounded
almost
like
distant
traffic
noises
He
considered
it
It
was
probably
just
the
wind
in
the
trees
he
decided
Captain
Memory
stopped
abruptly
causing
Ernie
to
just
about
pile
into
his
back
Hmm
he
said
peering
intently
forward
You
can
get
through
that
opening
right
there
the
Fly
s
voice
came
from
behind
As
usual
his
hyper
acute
vision
had
spotted
details
which
everyone
else
missed
Captain
Memory
pushed
through
a
narrow
gap
in
the
bushes
The
others
followed
Pushing
through
the
dense
brush
Ernie
emerged
on
to
a
clearing
No
it
was
a
lawn
A
big
mowed
lawn
About
fifty
yards
ahead
was
a
large
parking
lot
followed
by
a
huge
chrome
and
glass
office
building
In
the
distance
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
major
highway
from
which
Ernie
could
hear
what
were
indeed
traffic
sounds
HEY
A
gruff
voice
interrupted
them
Huh
Ernie
looked
around
confusedly
Get
outta
da
flower
bed
Ernie
looked
down
He
was
standing
on
top
of
a
dozen
beautiful
but
crushed
tulips
NOW
the
voice
demanded
Ernie
rushed
forward
onto
the
grass
destroying
dozens
more
beautiful
flowers
in
the
process
Ernie
looked
back
to
see
the
rest
of
the
group
carefully
picking
their
way
forward
through
the
flowers
careful
not
to
cause
any
more
damage
Ernie
looked
up
to
see
the
owner
of
the
gruff
voice
approaching
He
was
a
short
heavy
set
man
in
coveralls
smoking
a
cigar
He
appeared
to
be
the
groundskeeper
He
glanced
at
the
group
and
singled
out
Ernie
Look
whatcha
did
to
my
flowers
Whatsa
matter
with
you
kids
anyway
You
wanna
use
the
Park
you
follow
the
rules
You
stay
on
the
trail
you
don
t
go
walking
through
the
flower
beds
Park
Ernie
was
uncomprehending
Poodawumpus
Park
the
gardener
repeated
insistently
What
you
just
came
outta
You
stay
on
the
trail
you
follow
the
signs
you
don
t
be
tearin
up
the
bushes
He
glared
at
the
entire
group
Um
we
didn
t
see
any
signs
the
Fly
said
carefully
Aaah
the
damn
kids
tore
up
the
signs
again
Little
brats
I
ll
kill
em
The
groundskeeper
chomped
his
cigar
angrily
Um
there
were
these
natives
Ernie
began
uncertainly
Yeah
o
course
there
s
natives
It
s
a
nature
park
There
s
natural
natives
in
it
He
looked
at
Ernie
suspiciously
You
didn
t
feed
the
natives
didja
No
no
Ernie
protested
We
didn
t
even
get
near
em
Good
The
groundskeeper
seemed
slightly
placated
They
eat
what
s
not
on
their
diet
it
makes
em
sick
He
continued
to
regard
the
group
suspiciously
You
didn
t
leave
no
junk
in
there
didja
Damn
kids
party
in
there
on
weekends
leave
the
trail
fulla
junk
I
once
hadda
haul
a
whole
junk
car

there
He
glared
accusingly
at
the
foursome
No
no
Ernie
protested
We
re
real
neat
We
never
litter
We
don
t
allow
no
dogs
on
the
trail
neither
He
glared
at
Sterno
Sign
says
so
right
at
da
entrance
Um
we
didn
t
see
the
Fly
began
Yeah
yeah
I
know
Damn
kids

da
sign
Awright
I
ll
letcha
off
dis
time
but
next
time
I
swear
I
m
gonna
calla
cops
We
re
real
sorry
Ernie
began
edging
away
It
won
t
happen
again
The
group
started
moving
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
office
building
Yeah
yeah
the
groundskeeper
was
looking
ruefully
at
his
crushed
flowers
The
Fly
shook
his
head
Boy
is
he
gonna
be
mad
when
he
finds
the
Luna
Sssh
Sterno
warned
What
the
groundskeeper
turned
back
to
them
Uh
have
a
nice
day
Ernie
said
quickly
Good
bye
He
waved
cheerfully
and
started
walking
quickly
towards
the
office
building
The
others
followed
Ernie
was
confused
Why
is
there
an
office
building
here
he
asked
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
Looks
like
it
s
somebody
s
architecture
program
I
ve
heard
of
that
Sterno
commented
The
architects
model
a
building
in
Virtual
Reality
so
that
the
clients
can
see
if
they
like
it
or
not
before
it
s
actually
built
Well
we
might
as
well
take
a
look
at
their
handiwork
the
Captain
decided
The
continued
over
the
large
parking
lot
that
lay
in
front
of
them
It
was
almost
empty
only
an
occasional
car
was
parked
here
and
there
They
soon
reached
the
doors
of
the
building
and
entered
In
front
of
them
lay
a
small
utilitarian
lobby
typical
of
cheaply
constructed
office
buildings
In
the
center
of
the
lobby
was
a
booth
marked
Information
but
there
was
no
one
manning
it
Most
of
the
offices
appeared
to
be
closed
On
the
wall
was
a
directory
to
the
offices
in
the
building
which
the
Fly
was
reading
carefully
Mostly
lawyers
he
said
ruefully
We
may
need
a
lawyer
after
all
the
damage
HE
s
caused
Sterno
said
looking
at
Ernie
accusingly
Me
Ernie
protested
Oh
look
the
Fly
broke
in
There
s
an
office
that
s
open
He
pointed
down
a
long
corridor
Great
Ernie
enthused
glad
for
an
opportunity
to
change
the
subject
Maybe
we
can
go
in
and
ask
He
stopped
and
looked
at
Captain
Memory
expectantly
Uh
what
should
we
ask
them
Good
idea
Captain
Memory
agreed
although
Ernie
wasn
t
exactly
sure
what
it
was
that
the
Captain
was
agreeing
with
The
Captain
started
off
briskly
down
the
hall
in
the
direction
of
the
open
office
The
other
three
followed
behind
him
Ah
good
you
re
here
We
ve
been
expecting
you
An
efficient
looking
receptionist
in
a
crisp
white
uniform
greeted
them
cheerfully
See
the
Fly
pointed
out
brightly
They
ve
been
expecting
us
Therefore
we
must
be
in
the
right
place
The
Fly
was
quite
pleased
with
this
leap
of
logic
Ernie
looked
around
They
were
in
a
large
waiting
room
decorated
in
doctor
s
office
green
The
room
was
filled
with
rows
of
chairs
and
an
occasional
table
on
which
there
lay
heaps
of
very
old
magazines
In
the
background
some
easy
listening
music
was
playing
quietly
There
was
as
usual
no
one
else
there
Ernie
moaned
Oh
man
Why
would
they
be
expecting
us
We
re
not
even
supposed
to
be
here
What
s
going
ON
The
Fly
shook
his
head
I
dunno
man
sometimes
you
can
be
just
such
a
downer
Why
don
t
you
like
lighten
up
a
little
Obviously
sniffed
Sterno
We
must
be
in
the
right
place
because
they
are
after
all
expecting
us
How
could
they
be
expecting
us
if
we
weren
t
in
the
right
place
But
Ernie
began
The
receptionist
interrupted
The
doctor
will
see
you
now
She
opened
a
door
to
another
room
Oh
good
The
Fly
was
pleased
You
know
I
ve
been
having
this
pain
in
my
neck
He
began
rubbing
it
vigorously
Maybe
he
can
give
me
something
for
it
He
strode
purposefully
through
the
door
Ernie
shuffled
uncomfortably
I
hate
going
to
the
doctor
Oh
come
ON
Sterno
stood
impatiently
behind
Ernie
Don
t
be
such
a
baby
about
it
Ernie
sighed
and
followed
the
Fly
accompanied
by
Sterno
and
Captain
Memory
They
found
themselves
in
a
large
room
with
a
dozen
chairs
set
in
a
circle
A
few
of
the
chairs
were
occupied
In
one
a
fat
blond
woman
sat
nervously
munching
something
from
a
bag
on
her
lap
Two
chairs
to
the
left
sat
a
very
depressed
looking
young
man
wringing
his
hands
constantly
and
moaning
quietly
He
looked
steadfastly
at
the
floor
never
looking
up
A
little
further
on
sat
a
dishevelled
wild
eyed
man
who
kept
constantly
lighting
matches
Every
time
one
lit
he
would
laugh
hysterically
Against
one
wall
was
a
chair
that
was
larger
than
the
others
In
it
sat
an
older
man
in
an
old
fashioned
black
suit
He
was
bald
with
a
goatee
beard
and
smoked
a
cigar
He
carried
a
notepad
and
seemed
to
be
taking
notes
on
everything
that
was
happening
He
looked
up
Ah
gut
He
smiled
at
the
foursome
You
are
chust
in
time
for
ze
group
therapy
session
Please
sit
down
He
gestured
towards
the
empty
chairs
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
from
the
other
patients
The
foursome
sat
down
Ernie
carefully
placed
the
coffee
maker
by
his
side
Oh
you
must
be
the
doctor
The
Fly
observed
He
looked
around
confusedly
But
what
kind
of
doctor
are
you
A
psychiatrist
of
course
The
doctor
replied
You
have
been
having
hmm
some
problems
in
regard
to
your
appearance
ja
That
s
right
The
Fly
was
amazed
He
turned
to
the
others
I
wonder
how
he
knew
that
Sterno
looked
at
the
doctor
s
cigar
excitedly
I
say
you
wouldn
t
happen
to
have
an
extra
cigar
would
you
The
psychiatrist
produced
one
from
an
inner
pocket
of
his
jacket
Thanks
ever
so
much
Sterno
lit
the
cigar
and
puffed
contentedly
Ernie
was
suspicious
You
ve
got
a
German
accent
he
said
accusingly
The
psychiatrist
drew
himself
up
looking
very
offended
Dat
s
an
AUSTRIAN
accent
he
sniffed
I
have
studied
in
Vienna
with
ze
great
Dr
Freud
himself
He
peered
closely
at
Ernie
Zo
you
have
zis
feeling
zat
you
are
being
persecuted
ja
Zat
everyone
is
against
you
Ernie
was
taken
aback
Well
um
now
that
you
mention
it
yeah
Chust
as
ve
thought
the
psychiatrist
said
scribbling
something
on
his
notepad
Classic
paranoia
Ernie
was
about
to
protest
when
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
two
more
patients
entered
Ernie
looked
up
and
then
moaned
It
was
Lucy
and
Desi
Hi
guys
Lucy
waved
brightly
to
the
foursome
Chick
a
BOOM
agreed
Desi
He
seemed
to
have
acquired
a
new
Cuban
shirt
and
another
pair
of
maracas
They
sat
down
on
the
unoccupied
chairs
across
from
the
psychiatrist
Gut
exclaimed
the
doctor
Now
ve
are
all
here
ve
can
begin
He
turned
to
Lucy
Now
Lucy
last
veek

problem
Oh
doctor
Lucy
exclaimed
It
s
all

TV
shows

Earth
They
re
driving
me
crazy
Ach

The
psychiatrist
exclaimed
quietly
Und
vhy

Oh
doctor
Lucy
exclaimed
again
Every
time
we
turn
on
our
Vidicom
sets
on
my
home
planet
all
we
get
is
old
TV
shows
from
Earth
Our
sets

very
sensitive
and
your
signals
keep
drowning
ours
out
I
zee
said
the
doctor
thoughtfully
Und
you
find
zis
upsetting
Oh
doctor
cried
Lucy
again
We
re
not
humans
We
re
reptiles
We
don
t
wanna
watch
Earth
TV
shows
They
re
all
about
mammals
Lassie
My
Friend
Flicka
Leave
it
to
Beaver
They
re
all
MAMMALS
We
want
to
watch
our
OWN
TV
shows
About
REPTILES
She
seemed
very
upset
Ach
zo
the
doctor
nodded
Und
you
think
dat
if
you
conquer
ze
Earth
you
vould
feel
better
ja
Oh
doctor
Lucy
seemed
very
agitated
Don
t
you
see
We
ve
got
to
do
something
to
stop
those
TV
signals
We
just
can
t
stand
it
anymore
They
re
driving
us
CRAZY
The
doctor
nodded
thoughtfully
scribbling
notes
on
his
pad
He
thought
for
a
moment
But
you
are
light
years
from
here
so
you
are
just
now
receiving
signals
from
years
ago
ja
Yes
Lucy
agreed
tentatively
Zo
the
psychiatrist
continued
thoughtfully
Even
if
you
stop
ze
signals
today
you
vill
continue
to
receive
ze
signals
zat
have
already
been
sent
You
vill
continue
to
receive
ze
Earth
TV
shows
He
paused
expectantly
for
ze
NEXT
YEARS
NO
Lucy
screamed
She
buried
her
face
in
her
arms
sobbing
hysterically
I
can
t
stand
it
I
just
can
t
stand
it
She
continued
to
sob
uncontrollably
Ricky
patted
her
back
Chick
a
BOOM
he
said
commiseratingly
The
Fly
s
eyes
clouded
sympathetically
Aw
gee
His
antennae
waved
in
consternation
I
hate
to
see
a
woman
cry
Sterno
nodded
sagely
I
suppose
I
can
see
her
point
He
thought
for
a
moment
I
ve
always
rather
enjoyed
Lassie
though
A
thought
popped
into
Ernie
s
head
What
about
Rin
Tin
Tin
Not
bad
Sterno
agreed
thoughtfully
puffing
on
his
cigar
He
looked
almost
like
a
canine
version
of
the
psychiatrist
And
then
there
s
Sgt
Preston
of
the
Yukon
It
wouldn
t
be
a
bad
show
if
only
King
could
get
rid
of
that
silly
fellow
in
the
red
suit
MAMMALS
Lucy
screamed
sobbing
with
renewed
intensity
The
psychiatrist
stroked
his
beard
thoughtfully
Zere
is
perhaps
a
solution
Yes
Lucy
looked
up
expectantly
her
makeup
streaked
by
tears
It
seemed
to
Ernie
that
he
could
see
a
hint
of
something
green
beneath
it
Perhaps
ze
time
machine
the
doctor
seemed
deep
in
thought
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
in
confusion
Time
machine
he
whispered
It
isn
t
a
real
time
machine
the
Captain
explained
It
s
a
Virtual
time
machine
You
aren
t
actually
travelling
through
time
but
you
might
as
well
be
Like
when
we
went
back
to
four
billion
B
C
Oh
Ernie
was
not
exactly
following
this
but
he
noticed
the
others
glaring
at
him
so
he
decided
to
stop
The
psychiatrist
continued
Perhaps
you
could
go
back
in
time
back
years
und
stop
zese
signals
before
zey
start
Oh
doctor
Lucy
cried
hopefully
Do
you
really
think
it
would
work
Stop
TV
cried
the
Fly
obviously
very
upset
at
the
thought
Oh
no
How
could
we
survive
without
TV
It
would
be
the
end
of
of
The
Fly
tried
hard
to
think
what
it
would
be
the
end
of
Of
civilization
AS
WE
KNOW
IT
he
cried
triumphantly
True
the
psychiatrist
agreed
pensively
Lucy
s
eyes
began
to
fill
with
tears
But
perhaps
the
doctor
continued
slowly
Lucy
peered
at
him
expectantly
The
psychiatrist
went
on
Perhaps
it
would
not
be
stopped
but
chust
changed
a
little
So
dot
it
vould
not
be
a
bother
to
ze
space
creatures
Lucy
sat
up
excitedly
Oh
yes
Yes
She
turned
to
Ricky
Oh
Ricky
We
could
do
it
I
know
we
could
do
it
If
only
we
had
a
time
machine
The
psychiatrist
smiled
Vell
as
a
matter
of
fact
I
chust
happen
to
have
one
right
here
He
gestured
towards
a
door
that
Ernie
had
assumed
was
a
closet
Ernie
was
once
again
suspicious
What
would
a
psychiatrist
be
doing
with
a
time
machine
he
wanted
to
know
Oh
it
is
chust
ze
thing
for
ze
childhood
trauma
the
doctor
explained
You
go
back
in
time
prevent
ze
traumatic
incident
und
ze
patient
is
cured
Ernie
had
to
admit
that
this
did
in
fact
sound
reasonable
The
psychiatrist
peered
intently
at
Ernie
Vhen
did
you
first
notice
dat
you
felt
suspicious
of
everyone
Ernie
was
somewhat
taken
aback
by
this
sudden
change
in
questioning
Um
actually
he
though
about
it
It
started
when
I
first
went
into
the
Virtual
Arcade
Bye
guys
Lucy
interrupted
She
and
Ricky
were
standing
at
the
door
of
the
closet
or
time
machine
or
whatever
it
was
We
re
going
into
the
past
now
so
we
probably
won
t
be
seeing
you
anymore
Take
it
easy
cried
the
Fly
cheerfully
He
was
relieved
that
Lucy
had
stopped
crying
Um
A
thought
occurred
to
Ernie
Does
that
mean
that
you
re
not
