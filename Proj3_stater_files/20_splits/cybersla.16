the
sheep
They
re
asking
our
help
in
breaking
free
of
this
awful
tyranny
Wooly
Bully
that
reminds
me
of
something
Captain
Memory
became
thoughtful
The
Hully
Gully
perhaps
The
Fly
s
antennae
perked
up
The
Frug
The
Jerk
The
Mashed
Potato
he
suggested
The
Swim
Sterno
added
Or
even
The
TWIST
A
brilliant
idea
occurred
to
Ernie
I
know
This
must
be
The
Land
of
Dances
Sterno
turned
to
Ernie
with
a
look
of
utter
disgust
Look
we
ve
been
through
this
before
remember
Fondue
chocolate
watches
Heidi
remember
Ernie
became
subdued
You
re
trying
to
tell
me
this
is
Switzerland
right
The
Fly
s
antennae
twitched
excitedly
Oh
I
remember
that
now
Land
of
Dances
That
was
a
song
by
Cannibal
and
the
Headhunters
Cannibal
Ernie
started
He
thought
for
a
moment
On
the
other
hand
he
went
on
Switzerland
is
fine
Chocolate
Heidi
Fine
just
fine
Well
Sterno
sniffed
I
m
glad
THAT
S
settled
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
wrist
Watches
Did
you
say
watches
Ernie
looked
at
the
sheep
He
noticed
that
each
of
them
wore
rather
a
nice
Swiss
watch
on
one
of
their
front
forelegs
Captain
Memory
continued
to
look
at
his
bare
wrist
and
sighed
Oh
dear
I
m
afraid
it
s
getting
late
We
ll
have
to
be
going
Ernie
was
nonplussed
Aren
t
we
supposed
to
like
help
them
overthrow
the
evil
ruler
or
something
Captain
Memory
shrugged
It
s
not
my
problem
you
know
I
mean
we
can
t
do
everything
Baa
Baa
said
the
lead
sheep
insistently
The
sheep
wants
to
know
Sterno
translated
If
you
can
t
help
overthrow
the
Wooly
Bully
could
you
at
least
give
him
some
clue
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
his
daughter
She
s
been
missing
since
yesterday
and
he
s
afraid
something
terrible
might
have
happened
to
her
the
poor
little
lamb
Ernie
burped
Everyone
turned
to
look
at
him
Uh
who
me
I
don
t
know
anything
about
it
Why
would
I
know
anything
about
it
He
fidgeted
uncomfortably
compulsively
wiping
his
still
greasy
hands
on
his
fur
loincloth
Stop
looking
at
me
like
that
I
think
we
d
better
get
going
said
Captain
Memory
decisively
Now
The
four
turned
to
leave
Ernie
looked
back
at
the
group
of
sheep
He
smiled
weakly
trying
to
think
of
something
nice
to
say
in
Sheepish
Ba
he
waved
good
bye
The
lead
sheep
started
and
rose
up
on
his
hind
legs
looking
very
angry
and
offended
That
was
very
rude
Sterno
reproved
Ernie
Uh
what
did
I
say
asked
Ernie
bewildered
I
only
meant
After
ALL
Sterno
continued
You
ve
never
even
met
his
mother
And
even
if
you
had
I
seriously
doubt
she
would
have
consented
to
do
anything
like
that
with
YOU
Gee
I
m
sorry
I
Ernie
decided
that
perhaps
the
safest
thing
to
do
was
simply
be
quiet
The
four
continued
walking
Ernie
noticed
that
it
seemed
to
be
getting
warmer
Substantially
more
humid
too
Even
though
he
was
wearing
only
a
loincloth
Ernie
began
to
perspire
The
others
also
seemed
to
be
feeling
uncomfortable
from
the
heat
All
except
Captain
Memory
who
never
seemed
to
be
uncomfortable
at
all
As
the
sun
began
to
set
Ernie
noticed
that
the
vegetation
around
them
was
different
now
The
warm
area
they
were
heading
into
seemed
to
full
of
tropical
plants
Lush
flowers
and
tall
trees
loomed
ahead
of
them
In
fact
they
seemed
to
heading
into
a
jungle
Ernie
noticed
an
object
lying
in
the
grass
It
appeared
to
be
the
broken
remnants
of
a
vandalized
sign
of
some
sort
Ernie
could
just
barely
make
out
a
few
words
through
the
layers
of
graffiti
Pooda
something
Ernie
read
No
alcoholic
beverages
allowed
Do
not
feed
the
The
rest
was
gone
Something
about
it
made
Ernie
feel
very
uncomfortable
Um
is
it
really
a
good
idea
to
be
heading
into
the
jungle
at
night
Ernie
asked
nervously
Oh
you
re
right
said
Sterno
sarcastically
Let
s
just
check
into
a
Holiday
Inn
instead
Well
it
s
just
that
it
s
awfully
well
dark
Ernie
fidgeted
It
gets
that
way
at
night
Sterno
pointed
out
You
know
of
some
way
to
prevent
it
perhaps
Ernie
eyed
the
thick
jungle
vegetation
ahead
of
them
with
misgivings
What
if
there
s
um
hostile
natives
or
something
At
that
exact
moment
drums
began
pounding
in
the
distance
Ernie
began
to
feel
very
uneasy
Do
we
have
to
go
in
there
he
pleaded
No
not
at
all
Captain
Memory
pointed
out
We
can
just
stay
here
and
wait
for
the
Nazis
to
catch
up
with
us
if
you
like
Ernie
moaned
No
that
s
okay
Let
s
just
keep
going
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
I
dunno
nothing
seems
to
make
you
happy
You
don
t
want
to
go
you
don
t
want
to
stay
You
know
you
really
need
to
have
a
more
positive
attitude
Yeah
right
Ernie
grunted
They
continued
along
the
way
into
the
jungle
The
vegetation
seemed
to
swallow
them
up
The
heavy
masses
of
green
foliage
on
all
sides
seemed
to
offer
little
possibility
of
escape
The
continued
along
the
trail
which
became
ever
narrower
as
they
progressed
Look
the
Fly
pointed
ahead
It
was
now
almost
night
The
jungle
before
them
was
almost
pitch
black
However
off
to
the
left
small
points
of
light
could
be
seen
weaving
and
bobbing
in
and
out
of
the
foliage
in
the
distance
What
s
that
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Fireflies
Torches
the
Fly
corrected
It
s
those
villagers
we
saw
in
the
mountains
They
ve
come
to
meet
us
Isn
t
that
nice
Ernie
was
still
uneasy
Are
you
sure
they
re
friendly
villagers
The
Fly
peered
into
the
distance
They
sure
LOOK
friendly
It
looks
like
they
re
having
a
party
They
re
all
singing
and
dancing
As
the
villagers
approached
Ernie
began
to
be
able
to
make
out
what
they
were
singing
They
were
chanting
rhythmically
to
the
beat
of
the
drums
Na
na
na
na
na
na
na
na
na
Ernie
frowned
I
KNOW
that
song
It
s
um
it
s
Sure
the
Fly
broke
in
Land
of
Dances
What
a
great
song
AHA
cried
Ernie
See
I
told
you
I
was
right
He
turned
to
Sterno
See
This
is
The
Land
of
Dances
I
was
right
after
all
You
were
not
sniffed
Sterno
That
was
there
this
is
here
That
was
Switzerland
this
is
the
Land
of
Dances
Ernie
sulked
Well
I
was
sort
of
right
Anyway
this
is
The
Land
of
Dances
so
those
guys
with
the
torches
must
be
He
suddenly
turned
pale
CANNIBAL
AND
THE
HEADHUNTERS
Cool
agreed
the
Fly
Great
band
huh
What
are
we
gonna
DO
wailed
Ernie
Suddenly
they
were
distracted
by
a
loud
crashing
in
the
forest
behind
them
Gottverdammter
Schweinhund
The
crack
of
a
riding
crop
could
clearly
be
heard
They
turned
to
see
bright
fingers
of
white
light
as
though
from
high
powered
flashlights
probing
through
the
foliage
Zey
must
be
in
here
somevhere
they
heard
a
voice
call
out
Ze
trail
of
isotope
tracers
from
ze
radioactive
lamb
chops
leads
right
zis
vay
Ernie
pressed
his
hands
to
his
stomach
I
don
t
feel
good
he
moaned
Ernie
looked
up
to
find
the
other
three
glaring
at
him
How
was
I
to
know
the
lamb
chops
were
radioactive
he
protested
loudly
Do
you
think
I
would
have
eaten
them
if
I
knew
Ssh
The
four
heard
the
voice
behind
them
call
out
I
tink
I
hear
zem
Ernie
quickly
put
a
hand
over
his
mouth
Up
ahead
the
bobbing
torchlights
were
weaving
ever
closer
The
pounding
drums
and
chanting
was
getting
louder
The
chanting
had
changed
now
Oom
alla
Boom
Ernie
could
hear
Oom
alla
BOOM
From
behind
the
searchlights
were
weaving
ever
more
in
their
direction
slowly
beginning
to
focus
in
on
their
position
Ernie
whimpered
quietly
Hey
guys
look
at
this
the
Fly
pointed
to
something
in
the
darkness
Off
to
the
right
visible
only
to
the
Fly
s
huge
insect
eyes
a
faint
trail
split
off
from
the
main
path
Let
s
try
this
The
Fly
hurried
down
the
trail
The
others
followed
as
closely
as
possible
so
as
not
to
get
lost
in
the
increasing
darkness
The
four
scampered
along
the
dark
narrow
path
attempting
to
move
quickly
but
also
quietly
and
not
doing
a
very
good
job
of
either
The
sounds
of
pursuit
behind
them
seem
to
grow
ever
louder
The
trail
led
to
a
large
clearing
and
then
stopped
Surrounding
the
clearing
was
an
impenetrable
thicket
of
thorn
bushes
In
the
middle
of
the
clearing
was
a
large
iron
pot
big
enough
for
all
four
of
them
to
fit
into
at
the
same
time
It
sat
on
a
large
pile
of
neatly
arranged
firewood
A
heap
of
neatly
cut
up
potatoes
and
carrots
lay
nearby
I
don
t
like
the
looks
of
this
Ernie
moaned
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Can
t
you
get
us
out
of
here
he
pleaded
Captain
Memory
frowned
He
seemed
lost
in
thought
Well
I
suppose
it
s
worth
a
try
he
said
dubiously
With
that
he
turned
suddenly
and
slugged
Ernie
in
the
stomach
hard
Oof
Ernie
doubled
over
in
pain
Hey
what
BEEP
BEEP
BEEP
Ernie
was
astounded
at
the
sounds
coming
out
of
his
mouth
Good
Captain
Memory
cheered
It
still
works
Ernie
coughed
What
what
still
works
The
remote
Captain
Memory
seemed
particularly
cheerful
I
just
remembered
that
a
Franglian
remote
will
still
work
even
if
you
eat
it
Quality
construction
you
know
He
nodded
wisely
I
paid
a
little
extra
but
it
was
worth
it
The
Captain
regarded
Ernie
carefully
The
only
problem
is
it
s
a
little
hard
to
press
the
buttons
Let
me
see
Without
warning
he
elbowed
Ernie
violently
in
the
kidneys
Ernie
fell
to
the
ground
in
pain
He
opened
his
mouth
BEEP
BOOP
Captain
Memory
looked
embarrassed
Oh
sorry
Wrong
button
The
toe
of
his
boot
slammed
into
Ernie
s
ribs
BOOP
BEEP
There
we
go
Captain
Memory
exulted
Now
we
ve
got
it
Ernie
lay
in
the
dirt
moaning
Captain
Memory
reached
down
to
help
him
to
his
feet
Sorry
about
that
he
apologized
Still
you
have
to
expect
that
sort
of
thing
if
you
re
going
to
go
around
eating
remote
control
units
Ernie
staggered
to
his
feet
moaning
Look
the
Fly
pointed
up
into
the
sky
A
bright
object
seemed
to
be
descending
in
their
direction
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
Ah
here
he
comes
Right
on
time
The
Captain
looked
at
his
wrist
more
closely
Well
almost
on
time
As
the
bright
object
approached
Ernie
began
to
make
it
out
more
clearly
It
looked
like
well
it
looked
like
an
overly
large
Plymouth
taxi
It
had
huge
fins
two
tone
paint
and
rather
a
lot
of
rust
Captain
Memory
gestured
proudly
towards
it
as
it
came
in
for
a
landing
There
it
is
guys
he
announced
proudly
The
Luna
C
Ain
t
she
a
beauty
Sterno
glanced
behind
them
The
sounds
of
commotion
back
on
the
trail
were
increasing
Not
a
moment
too
soon
he
muttered
Ernie
watched
the
Luna
C
as
it
approached
for
a
landing
He
noticed
that
it
seemed
to
be
coming
in
rather
fast
With
a
deafening
crash
the
Luna
C
slammed
into
the
ground
throwing
a
cloud
of
dust
and
dirt
in
all
directions
As
the
dust
settled
Ernie
noticed
a
hubcap
rolling
listlessly
away
finally
coming
to
a
stop
by
a
nearby
tree
Captain
Memory
winced
but
then
quickly
regained
his
composure
He
started
towards
the
spacecraft
The
driver
s
side
door
of
the
Luna
C
opened
and
a
lanky
individual
with
long
unkempt
hair
got
out
He
was
wearing
a
loud
Hawaiian
shirt
and
dark
sunglasses
even
though
it
was
night
He
waved
at
Captain
Memory
Hey
dude
what
s
happenin
Hey
Ralph
Captain
Memory
waved
cheerily
at
the
driver
This
is
my
pilot
Ralph
he
introduced
the
man
to
the
group
as
they
all
sprinted
towards
the
spacecraft
Sterno
eyed
the
Luna
C
suspiciously
This
is
your
ship
That
s
it
Captain
Memory
waved
at
it
proudly
Then
how
come
it
says
Taxi
on
it
Sterno
asked
pointedly
Captain
Memory
s
face
fell
Well
well
I
was
supposed
to
get
a
limo
Well
they
told
me
I
could
have
a
limo
but
there
was
this
budget
problem
Anyway
I
could
ve
had
a
company
car
for
sure
except
um
there
was
that
problem
about
my
license
So
anyway
He
trailed
off
uncomfortably
So
you
hadda
take
a
cab
Sterno
finished
for
him
Well
well
Flustered
Captain
Memory
broke
off
Yeah
Ernie
noticed
that
the
sounds
behind
them
were
getting
awfully
close
Uh
could
we
talk
about
this
someplace
else
Captain
Memory
glanced
back
down
the
trail
You
re
right
He
turned
to
Ralph
Let
s
cruise
Ralph
looked
uncomfortable
Uh
I
wanted
to
tell
you
dude
We
got
a
little
problem
Let
s
talk
about
it
on
the
way
he
suggested
glancing
back
down
the
trail
The
guys
around
here
are
um
uncool
Ralph
nodded
understandingly
I
can
dig
it
He
got
into
the
driver
s
seat
while
the
other
four
piled
into
the
roomy
back
seat
Ralph
shifted
into
Fly
and
stomped
on
the
accelerator
The
Luna
C
instantly
shot
thirty
feet
straight
up
into
the
air
violently
flipped
upside
down
and
hung
there
unmoving
Ernie
Sterno
and
the
Fly
suddenly
found
themselves
upside
down
in
a
very
uncomfortable
position
laying
halfway
on
the
roof
and
halfway
in
their
seats
Captain
Memory
and
Ralph
however
were
sitting
quite
comfortably
in
their
seats
as
though
glued
into
them
So
like
I
was
saying
dude
Ralph
went
on
conversationally
We
got
this
little
problem
In
the
position
he
was
in
Ernie
could
see
the
ground
beneath
them
quite
clearly
through
the
Luna
C
s
large
rear
window
Their
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
commotion
taking
place
The
probing
searchlights
and
the
bobbing
torches
seemed
to
have
come
together
Ernie
heard
shouts
screams
machine
gun
fire
Then
all
was
silent
After
a
few
moments
the
drums
and
chanting
began
again
Oom
alla
boom
Oom
alla
BOOM
Ernie
could
see
a
fire
being
lit
beneath
the
huge
iron
pot
It
looked
as
though
the
Cannibals
were
going
to
have
their
feast
after
all
Ernie
s
attention
returned
to
the
conversation
inside
the
space
taxi
Ralph
was
telling
his
story
animatedly
so
I
wired
the
framistatter
to
the
quark
generator
Ralph
could
see
that
Captain
Memory
was
about
to
say
something
but
he
cut
him
off
Yeah
I
know
you
re
not
supposed
to
do
it
I
know
Warning
Do
Not
Bypass
Overload
Protection
Who
listens
to
that
crap
So
anyway
it
really
kicked
up
the
horsepower
you
know
what
I
mean
And
when
the
light
turned
green
man
I
was
outta
there
Those
guys
in
the
Vette
man
they
couldn
t
believe
it
You
shoulda
seen
their
faces
It
was
So
what
happened
Captain
Memory
interrupted
Ralph
became
suddenly
subdued
Okay
so
maybe
the
left
rear
antimatter
coupler
got
toasted
It
s
no
biggie
We
ll
stop
at
the
parts
store
we
ll
pick
up
a
new
one
It
s
just
a
couple
bucks
It
was
worth
it
You
shoulda
seen
those
guys
faces
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
I
got
some
bad
news
for
you
Ralph
The
parts
store
s
closed
Oh
MAN
Ralph
was
annoyed
You
mean
we
re
gonna
have
to
hang
out
until
the
store
opens
What
a
drag
Ralph
shook
his
head
unhappily
So
like
when
does
it
open
Captain
Memory
regarded
his
wrist
carefully
Let
s
see
it
s
right
now
So
I
would
say
it
ll
probably
open
in
about
oh
two
billion
years
Oh
MAN
Ralph
was
really
upset
I
can
t
wait
two
billion
years
I
got
a
date
on
Friday
Ernie
whimpered
Does
that
mean
the
ship
won
t
fly
Hey
be
cool
Ralph
said
comfortingly
Sure
it
ll
fly
It
s
just
a
little
uh
handling
problem
That
s
all
Fly
s
great
Just
doesn
t
uh
handle
exactly
right
It
was
beginning
to
occur
to
Ralph
that
perhaps
wiring
the
framisttater
to
the
quark
generator
might
not
have
been
such
a
good
idea
after
all
Handling
problem
inquired
Sterno
and
he
wriggled
about
trying
to
find
a
comfortable
position
in
the
upside
down
vehicle
Is
this
part
of
the
handling
problem
Hey
it
flies
fine
Ralph
insisted
So
maybe
it
s
upside
down
I
mean
And
sideways
Captain
Memory
reminded
Ralph
Oh
yeah
Ralph
became
quiet
Sideways
Okay
so
it
only
goes
upside
down
and
sideways
Hey
it
s
no
biggie
It
gets
you
where
you
re
going
right
Okay
so
maybe
you
wouldn
t
want
to
take
any
long
trips
in
it
right
now
but
it
get
s
you
Uh
well
it
gets
you
to
the
parts
store
he
concluded
triumphantly
The
parts
store
s
closed
Ralph
Captain
Memory
reminded
him
gently
The
Fly
s
antennae
suddenly
quivered
I
know
he
said
excitedly
How
about
Road
Service
Can
you
call
for
a
tow
Ralph
fidgeted
uncomfortably
Well
um
I
sorta
been
having
this
problem
with
the
towing
company
There
s
this
um
unpaid
balance
Ernie
and
the
Fly
looked
at
Captain
Memory
He
shrugged
Hey
I
don
t
got
insurance
you
know
Captain
Memory
suddenly
perked
up
Hey
Ralph
he
cried
What
about
Warp
drive
Ralph
brightened
and
then
slowly
resumed
his
glum
expression
Uh
well
I
don
t
think
you
wanna
use
the
Warp
drive
right
now
he
shook
his
head
sadly
Captain
Memory
frowned
Why
not
Ralph
fidgeted
Well
it
s
been
kinda
acting
up
a
little
he
explained
I
been
meaning
to
get
something
done
about
it
Just
yesterday
I
said
to
myself
Ralph
you
know
you
really
oughta
get
that
warp
drive
took
care
of
But
uh
you
know
it
s
like
fifty
credits
minimum
just
to
have
em
look
at
it
and
uh
He
trailed
off
Captain
Memory
looked
confused
Didn
t
you
get
the
Repair
Requisition
Voucher
from
the
Main
Office
Ralph
looked
very
uncomfortable
Um
uh
yeah
Well
the
other
night
me
and
the
boys
was
playing
a
little
cards
see
and
I
had
this
great
hand
I
had
three
Galaxies
How
could
I
lose
right
But
I
was
all
outta
chips
All
I
had
left
was
the
Voucher
so
I
said
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
That
s
against
the
rules
Ralph
Ralph
sighed
Well
how
was
I
to
know
the
other
guy
had
five
Nebulae
You
know
what
the
odds
against
that
are
Ernie
racked
his
brains
for
a
solution
to
the
problem
Maybe
we
could
just
sort
of
give
it
a
try
he
suggested
hopefully
Ralph
sighed
Well
I
thought
of
that
but
last
time
I
tried
it
I
wound
up
in
um
Dimension
Captain
Memory
was
startled
Dimension
Oh
no
wonder
He
chuckled
You
sure
don
t
wanna
wind
up
in
Dimension
do
you
Ralph
nodded
his
head
glumly
That
s
for
sure
They
all
fell
silent
After
a
few
minutes
Ernie
heard
the
sound
of
snoring
He
squinted
through
the
near
complete
darkness
the
only
light
coming
from
the
lights
on
the
dashboard
Ralph
seemed
to
have
dropped
off
to
sleep
Captain
Memory
seemed
to
be
nodding
as
well
Lacking
any
better
ideas
Ernie
slowly
worked
himself
around
to
a
comfortable
position
and
fell
asleep
as
well
CHAPTER
It
was
dawn
when
Ernie
awoke
During
the
night
the
Luna
C
seemed
to
have
drifted
quietly
to
the
ground
and
was
now
lying
on
it
s
top
in
the
dirt
Ernie
peered
out
the
windows
The
clearing
was
deserted
but
signs
of
last
night
s
revelry
remained
The
large
iron
pot
was
tipped
over
on
it
s
side
empty
Various
bones
lay
scattered
about
Lying
here
and
there
was
what
appeared
to
be
an
occasional
jackboot
Ernie
tried
not
to
look
at
them
After
a
few
moments
the
others
began
to
stir
The
Fly
moaned
Oh
man
I
hate
sleeping
in
the
car
Look
at
my
suit
It
s
all
rumpled
Only
Sterno
seemed
comfortable
curled
up
in
a
doglike
position
on
the
ceiling
of
the
upside
down
space
taxi
Ernie
twisted
uncomfortably
He
was
feeling
very
stiff
and
achy
after
sleeping
in
an
odd
position
in
the
car
Thinking
about
it
his
stomach
didn
t
feel
very
good
either
Captain
Memory
blinked
confusedly
and
looked
around
Ralph
yawned
The
Captain
looked
pointedly
at
Ralph
Well
he
said
unhappily
I
guess
there
s
no
getting
around
it
is
there
Oh
no
said
Ralph
dejectedly
You
gotta
do
it
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
despondently
You
re
gonna
have
to
call
the
office
Oh
MAN
Ralph
didn
t
seem
to
like
this
idea
at
all
I
hate
calling
the
office
They
always
give
me
a
hard
time
They
ll
probably
leave
me
on
hold
forever
too
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
It
s
gotta
