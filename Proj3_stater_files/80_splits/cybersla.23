How
dare
they
interrupt
his
game
show
to
deliver
a
letter
And
just
exactly
who
was
this
message
from
anyway
And
what
did
it
really
mean
Von
Liederkranz
examined
the
letter
carefully
Zo
he
said
thoughtfully
You
owe
ze
bank
one
hundred
and
ninety
five
quadrillion
dollars
Just
as
we
thought
Of
course
it
wasn
t
really
what
he
thought
at
all
The
Nazi
s
eyes
narrowed
Zis
one
hundred
and
ninety
five
quadrillion
dollars
it
is
a
great
deal
of
money
ja
Ja
I
mean
yes
agreed
Ernie
It
is
more
even
than
I
make
in
a
veek
Von
Liederkranz
eyed
Ernie
suspiciously
Zo
how
is
it
dot
you
come
to
owe
zo
much
money
Well
you
see
there
was
this
problem
with
cigar
butts
two
billion
years
ago
Ernie
explained
nervously
He
didn
t
like
the
Nazi
s
tone
of
voice
and
he
particularly
didn
t
like
the
Hot
Whirling
Corkscrew
And
then
we
were
at
the
bank
and
I
had
to
go
and
open
my
big
mouth
and
so
then
SCHWEINHUND
Von
Liederkranz
whipped
Ernie
with
the
letter
Do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
No
one
could
possibly
owe
zis
much
money
Obviously
zis
is
some
sort
of
secret
code
Now
who
vould
be
sending
you
secret
coded
messages
HERE
on
mein
own
game
show
Ernie
looked
pleadingly
at
Captain
Memory
the
Captain
just
shrugged
Von
Liederkranz
continued
reflectively
Und
how
could
zey
know
vhere
to
find
you
vis
zis
message
unless
He
whirled
to
face
his
guards
One
of
YOU
is
a
traitor
Nein
Nein
The
guards
blanched
and
backed
away
Von
Liederkranz
looked
at
the
audience
Or
perhaps
one
of
YOU
NEIN
NEIN
the
audience
cried
out
in
unison
fidgeting
uncomfortably
in
their
seats
Von
Liederkranz
advanced
on
the
audience
the
Hot
Whirling
Corkscrew
spinning
and
glowing
in
his
hand
Zo
you
vill
not
confess
eh
he
shrieked
at
the
audience
Perhaps
a
taste
of
the
Corkscrew
vill
loosen
your
tongues
Ernie
felt
a
tap
on
his
shoulder
Captain
Memory
beckoned
towards
the
back
of
the
stage
All
eyes
were
riveted
on
von
Liederkranz
and
on
the
hissing
spinning
torture
device
in
his
hand
No
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
the
foursome
They
tiptoed
into
the
wings
and
back
behind
the
stage
As
they
left
they
began
to
hear
screams
coming
from
somewhere
in
the
audience
They
hurried
along
the
corridor
leading
to
the
dressing
rooms
backstage
Unfortunately
there
seemed
to
be
no
exits
anywhere
in
that
part
of
the
building
The
only
exits
were
through
the
main
floor
which
would
have
required
them
to
go
back
out
onto
the
stage
This
did
not
seem
like
a
very
good
idea
An
empty
dressing
room
beckoned
ahead
of
them
They
hurried
into
it
and
locked
the
door
behind
them
The
screams
were
still
audible
inside
the
room
Hey
guys
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
Like
what
are
we
gonna
do
now
Ernie
sneezed
I
wish
they
wouldn
t
keep
the
air
conditioning
turned
up
so
high
he
complained
shivering
Well
if
you
re
going
to
go
around
wearing
nothing
but
that
ridiculous
fur
loincloth
you
have
to
expect
to
get
a
chill
commented
Sterno
unsympathetically
We
d
all
feel
a
lot
better
if
you
d
cover
up
some
of
that
pallid
skin
of
yours
Hey
that
s
an
idea
the
Fly
chimed
in
This
is
a
dressing
room
Maybe
there
s
some
clothes
here
you
can
wear
That
seemed
like
a
good
idea
to
Ernie
He
d
been
uncomfortably
cold
ever
since
he
d
put
that
silly
loincloth
on
He
began
looking
through
the
closet
but
found
only
filmy
negligees
and
harem
girl
outfits
Hey
there
s
a
whole
wardrobe
room
next
door
the
Fly
pointed
to
an
adjoining
room
Take
a
look
in
there
Ernie
disappeared
into
the
next
room
Sterno
was
searching
the
room
carefully
What
cha
looking
for
secret
passages
the
Fly
asked
eagerly
Actually
I
was
rather
hoping
someone
might
have
left
a
spot
of
brandy
about
he
answered
Aha
He
pulled
out
a
bottle
A
look
of
disappointment
appeared
on
his
face
MD
he
asked
What
in
the
world
could
that
be
Oh
wow
commented
the
Fly
Mad
Dog
I
beg
your
pardon
snapped
Sterno
huffily
Hey
no
offense
said
the
Fly
quickly
That
s
just
what
it
s
called
you
know
Hmmph
Sterno
opened
the
bottle
and
sniffed
the
contents
Dreadful
he
proclaimed
and
dropped
the
bottle
in
the
trash
Ernie
reappeared
from
the
wardrobe
room
He
was
now
clad
in
a
Spanish
toreador
outfit
consisting
of
a
scintillating
gold
suit
covered
with
sequins
with
knee
breeches
and
white
stockings
a
white
shirt
and
tie
and
an
odd
shaped
little
black
hat
He
noticed
everyone
looking
at
him
oddly
Hey
it
was
the
only
thing
I
could
find
you
know
Ernie
said
defensively
At
least
it
s
warm
Sterno
sniffed
I
must
say
you
have
the
most
AWFUL
taste
in
clothes
But
at
least
it
s
better
than
looking
at
that
sickening
body
of
yours
Ernie
was
offended
What
s
wrong
with
my
body
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
silently
Only
the
Fly
seemed
to
approve
of
Ernie
s
new
outfit
Hey
guy
he
said
enthusiastically
I
like
the
suit
It
s
the
new
in
