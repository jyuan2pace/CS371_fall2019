gets
synchronized
with
it
and
your
system
becomes
adapted
to
it
If
it
suddenly
crashes
it
causes
a
tremendous
shock
to
your
system
What
you
mean
we
re
going
through
all
this
just
to
avoid
an
upset
stomach
or
something
Sterno
asked
sarcastically
After
all
how
bad
could
it
be
Well
um
the
Captain
looked
very
uncomfortable
It
s
not
just
an
upset
stomach
Okay
Sterno
demanded
Then
what
DOES
it
cause
Um
generally
cardiac
arrest
the
Captain
answered
reluctantly
Sterno
was
shocked
You
mean
if
you
crash
the
system
it
ll
KILL
us
Afraid
so
the
Captain
nodded
sadly
Along
with
anybody
else
who
s
hooked
into
the
system
at
the
time
Ernie
began
to
worry
What
about
ending
the
game
then
Won
t
that
kill
us
too
Does
that
mean
we
re
trapped
here
forever
He
began
to
panic
No
no
calm
down
said
the
Captain
reassuringly
if
we
end
the
game
within
the
confines
of
it
s
own
logic
it
ll
shut
down
in
an
orderly
manner
giving
your
systems
time
to
readjust
before
you
re
returned
to
reality
It
won
t
be
a
shock
to
your
systems
and
your
hearts
won
t
stop
It
s
only
if
it
suddenly
abruptly
stops
like
when
the
system
crashes
that
Okay
okay
we
get
the
picture
Sterno
broke
it
Don
t
crash
the
system
Okay
Captain
Memory
returned
to
the
TV
Guide
Ernie
sighed
It
was
bad
enough
being
trapped
in
a
computer
game
Now
his
life
was
in
danger
as
well
And
his
only
hope
seems
to
be
this
costumed
clown
who
thinks
he
s
a
super
hero
Wasn
t
this
ever
going
to
stop
getting
worse
Suddenly
Captain
Memory
started
Oh
NO
he
wailed
Not
THAT
What
happened
What
happened
cried
Ernie
panic
stricken
What
could
possibly
have
happened
that
was
worse
than
the
predicament
they
were
already
in
Captain
Memory
was
still
holding
the
TV
Guide
We
missed
Gilligan
s
Island
Ernie
cradled
his
head
in
his
hands
I
can
t
stand
it
I
just
can
t
stand
it
Chapter
Ernie
was
beginning
to
feel
a
little
bit
better
After
all
nothing
really
weird
had
happened
for
about
oh
twenty
minutes
or
so
Things
were
relatively
speaking
pretty
quiet
Ernie
examined
his
surroundings
What
is
this
place
It
s
a
spaceship
said
Captain
Memory
conversationally
Ernie
was
skeptical
It
doesn
t
LOOK
like
a
spaceship
Sterno
sniffed
They
don
t
have
to
always
be
those
ghastly
chrome
and
glass
space
things
Utterly
tasteless
This
place
Sterno
looked
about
approvingly
Is
actually
not
bad
Ernie
was
unconvinced
It
s
not
moving
Sure
it
is
the
Captain
returned
You
just
can
t
feel
it
Wanna
look
out
Captain
Memory
stood
up
and
walked
over
to
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
harpsichord
He
regarded
the
keys
Let
s
see
Um
C
Major
He
hit
the
appropriate
keys
With
a
deep
rumbling
sound
the
ceiling
slid
back
revealing
a
view
of
deep
space
Ah
Captain
Memory
was
pleased
He
returned
to
the
sofa
Ernie
regarded
the
view
with
amazement
Stars
and
galaxies
burned
brightly
against
the
blackness
of
space
They
seemed
to
be
an
incredible
distance
from
Earth
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Where
ARE
we
The
Captain
shrugged
Space
But
where
in
space
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Are
we
far
from
Earth
Captain
Memory
concentrated
Let
s
see
um
Long
long
ago
in
a
galaxy
far
far
Ernie
frowned
The
Captain
stopped
Wait
that
s
not
right
He
furrowed
his
brow
Well
I
can
t
exactly
recall
where
we
are
but
it
doesn
t
really
matter
Captain
Memory
was
absorbed
in
looking
at
the
vista
of
deep
space
After
all
when
you
wish
upon
a
star
it
makes
no
difference
where
you
are
Ernie
frowned
Something
about
that
bugs
me
It
doesn
t
sound
quite
cricket
agreed
Sterno
Well
by
jiminy
exclaimed
the
Captain
We
ll
just
have
to
move
on
to
something
else
Wanna
watch
some
TV
I
d
rather
not
said
Ernie
Aww
Captain
Memory
was
disappointed
Ernie
looked
around
Are
we
safe
here
For
the
moment
the
Captain
shrugged
As
I
said
we
can
t
stay
anywhere
too
long
Waldo
will
zero
in
on
us
if
we
do
Then
what
Ernie
wanted
to
know
I
dunno
the
Captain
mused
I
suppose
he
ll
come
after
us
Ernie
frowned
You
mean
he
ll
come
in
himself
like
personally
Captain
Memory
thought
about
that
Well
I
don
t
suppose
he
ll
come
in
AS
himself
After
all
you
can
be
anyone
or
anyTHING
in
Cyperspace
He
ll
come
in
the
form
of
someone
else
some
famous
person
or
someone
he
d
like
to
be
Like
you
and
your
super
hero
outfit
Sterno
broke
in
Well
yeah
the
Captain
admitted
Ernie
gave
than
some
thought
So
what
form
would
an
evil
genius
want
to
take
Captain
Memory
shrugged
I
dunno
A
Nazi
maybe
He
returned
to
the
TV
Guide
This
is
much
like
my
own
Virtual
Reality
mused
Sterno
He
seemed
to
have
found
a
snifter
of
brandy
somewhere
which
he
swirled
pensively
in
his
left
paw
I
had
a
drawing
room
like
this
I
wrote
poetry
there
Immortal
odes
to
the
glory
of
the
canine
race
Really
Captain
Memory
was
not
really
paying
attention
