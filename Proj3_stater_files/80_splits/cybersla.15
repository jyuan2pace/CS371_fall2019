was
saying
That
fabulous
Frenchman
Henri
Gruyere
This
isn
t
the
Truth
or
Consequences
I
remember
said
Ernie
suspiciously
As
usual
no
one
was
listening
Gut
efening
ladies
und
gentlemen
the
host
was
saying
He
was
an
unpleasant
looking
man
wearing
a
traditional
French
outfit
red
striped
shirt
scarf
beret
The
only
things
that
seemed
a
bit
out
of
place
were
his
monocle
and
jackboots
First
of
all
he
continued
I
vould
like
to
point
out
dot
I
am
French
I
am
not
German
Not
at
all
Not
efen
a
little
bit
Wait
a
minute
said
Sterno
suspiciously
Something
smells
here
Hmm
Captain
Memory
looked
up
unconcernedly
Think
about
it
cried
Sterno
Don
t
you
realize
His
name
Gruyere
It
s
CHEESE
But
it
was
as
usual
too
late
Sudden
brightness
dazzled
Ernie
s
eyes
As
his
vision
cleared
he
found
himself
standing
on
a
game
show
stage
with
Captain
Memory
and
Sterno
beside
him
He
blinked
and
staggered
disoriented
by
the
sudden
change
of
scene
He
moaned
and
held
his
head
until
the
sickening
swimming
sensation
stopped
Ernie
looked
up
He
was
facing
the
audience
He
noticed
something
odd
about
the
people
watching
Oh
that
s
it
he
thought
They
re
all
wearing
Nazi
uniforms
I
thought
you
said
this
couldn
t
happen
he
said
to
Captain
Memory
accusingly
I
thought
you
said
there
was
a
million
to
one
chance
of
us
getting
sucked
in
through
a
TV
again
Captain
memory
shrugged
So
I
was
wrong
he
admitted
So
sue
me
The
game
shoe
host
turned
to
the
threesome
Perhaps
you
vould
like
to
step
through
door
number
three
the
host
said
to
them
Ernie
turned
around
A
number
of
very
nice
prizes
were
displayed
on
the
stage
a
red
sports
car
furniture
some
shiny
new
appliances
Several
very
attractive
women
in
cut
down
outfits
were
standing
around
the
stage
Unfortunately
they
all
carried
guns
which
they
held
trained
on
Ernie
and
the
others
Captain
Memory
was
replying
to
the
talk
show
host
No
I
don
t
think
we
would
care
to
step
through
door
number
three
Thanks
just
the
same
The
talk
show
host
laughed
unpleasantly
I
vould
strongly
recommend
dot
you
step
through
door
number
three
he
said
urgently
No
we
d
really
rather
not
answered
the
Captain
pleasantly
The
host
s
face
darkened
You
vill
shtep
through
dat
door
NOW
The
women
s
fingers
tightened
menacingly
on
their
triggers
Oh
well
if
you
put
it
that
way
the
three
of
them
found
themselves
prodded
towards
door
number
three
The
door
opened
in
front
of
them
and
they
found
themselves
thrust
into
blackness
The
door
slammed
behind
them
with
a
resounding
crash
Ernie
blinked
As
his
eyes
began
to
adjust
he
could
see
that
the
room
they
were
in
was
not
entirely
dark
A
small
amount
of
light
came
in
from
a
barred
window
high
up
on
the
opposite
wall
They
were
in
a
large
chamber
with
damp
stone
walls
and
a
dirt
floor
It
seemed
to
be
a
dungeon
Oh
great
Ernie
muttered
So
this
is
what
s
behind
door
number
three
It
could
ve
been
worse
said
Captain
Memory
jovially
Oh
yeah
Ernie
returned
glumly
How
It
could
ve
been
door
number
four
So
What
s
the
big
deal
about
door
number
four
Oh
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
You
don
t
ever
want
to
go
behind
door
number
four
Ernie
didn
t
like
the
sound
of
that
So
what
is
it
It
s
the
worst
Captain
Memory
went
on
ominously
I
mean
it
s
just
too
horrible
A
voice
came
from
out
of
the
darkness
Hi
guys
Ernie
was
taken
aback
It
hadn
t
occurred
to
him
that
someone
else
might
be
in
the
dungeon
with
them
A
figure
approached
from
out
of
the
darkness
Ernie
gasped
It
was
a
horrendous
creature
with
the
body
of
a
human
but
the
tremendously
enlarged
head
of
a
fly
complete
with
huge
faceted
eyes
antennae
and
a
long
trunk
like
snout
It
was
wearing
rather
a
nice
designer
suit
Say
the
creature
continued
Have
any
of
you
guys
seen
my
date
Ernie
stared
soundlessly
Captain
Memory
shrugged
Sorry
The
creature
sighed
She
seemed
like
such
a
nice
girl
too
The
creature
shuffled
back
and
forth
scuffing
his
expensive
designer
shoes
in
the
dirt
Ernie
peered
at
the
creature
He
didn
t
seem
to
be
menacing
at
all
Quite
the
contrary
In
fact
he
seemed
quite
unhappy
But
then
again
Ernie
thought
it
s
kind
of
hard
to
read
expressions
on
a
fly
Aww
that
s
okay
guys
the
Fly
said
sadly
You
don
t
have
to
tell
me
I
can
figure
it
out
She
took
off
right
He
sighed
Just
like
all
the
others
Poor
guy
Ernie
thought
His
date
stood
him
up
Ernie
could
sympathize
he
d
been
in
situations
like
that
himself
Of
course
this
guy
did
have
an
unusual
problem
I
know
the
Fly
continued
It
s
my
looks
right
His
antennae
drooped
sadly
One
little
accident
and
there
goes
your
whole
social
life
Ernie
felt
awkward
What
was
he
expected
to
say
in
a
situation
like
this
Nothing
apparently
for
the
Fly
went
on
I
mean
I
ve
got
a
nice
personality
I
m
intelligent
I
m
a
fun
guy
