fact
Wanna
watch
Stump
the
Stars
Captain
Memory
said
to
Ernie
cutting
off
Sterno
s
tales
of
past
glory
What
s
that
about
inquired
Ernie
It
s
this
game
show
where
famous
Hollywood
celebrities
have
to
answer
these
questions
and
if
they
get
them
wrong
they
get
their
arms
and
legs
chopped
off
Stumps
get
it
Captain
Memory
laughed
Ernie
frowned
I
don
t
like
these
new
game
shows
He
glanced
at
the
television
The
program
seemed
to
be
a
game
show
The
MC
was
an
unpleasant
looking
man
wearing
a
black
military
uniform
with
skulls
on
the
collar
He
wore
a
monocle
in
his
left
eye
and
carried
a
riding
crop
which
he
periodically
cracked
against
his
jackboots
Oh
it
s
one
of
those
sadistic
Nazi
game
show
hosts
said
Ernie
Isn
t
there
anything
else
on
Captain
Memory
was
paging
through
a
copy
of
TV
Guide
Doesn
t
look
like
there
s
anything
on
except
game
shows
How
about
Vomit
for
Dollars
Ernie
grimaced
Here
s
a
movie
the
Captain
continued
How
about
The
Humpback
of
Notre
Dame
starring
Ronald
Reagan
You
know
the
one
about
the
whale
that
plays
football
Ernie
sighed
What
s
this
we
re
watching
now
I
don
t
know
Captain
Memory
reached
for
a
dial
Let
s
turn
up
the
volume
and
find
out
The
off
camera
announcer
s
voice
came
blasting
out
off
the
set
painfully
loud
time
for
Wheel
of
Torture
The
show
which
every
week
asks
the
question
How
much
can
you
take
The
sound
of
applause
welled
up
from
the
audience
And
here
s
our
host
the
announcer
continued
The
Gestapo
s
greatest
that
famous
fiend
Sturmbannfuhrer
Dr
Heinz
von
Liederkranz
Once
again
the
sound
of
applause
welled
up
The
sound
seemed
to
be
growing
impossibly
loud
In
fact
it
seemed
to
be
coming
from
all
around
them
The
game
show
host
smiled
and
bowed
to
the
audience
Tank
you
tank
you
Now
let
s
drag
in
today
s
first
victim
The
announcer
continued
From
Palo
Alto
California
let
s
have
a
big
round
of
applause
for
CAPTAIN
MEMORY
The
huge
waves
of
applause
filled
Ernie
s
head
blocking
out
everything
else
He
clenched
his
eyes
tightly
trying
to
regain
his
composure
He
opened
them
again
and
staggered
back
in
shock
They
were
no
longer
in
the
suburban
living
room
They
were
actually
standing
on
the
stage
that
they
had
been
watching
only
seconds
before
They
had
actually
been
sucked
INTO
the
game
show
Captain
Memory
seemed
confused
Hey
uh
wait
a
minute
I
didn
t
The
announcer
continued
And
here
s
contestant
number
two
From
the
Land
that
Time
Forgets
let
s
have
a
big
hand
for
Goombah
the
Barbarian
Ernie
realized
that
they
meant
him
A
Nazi
SS
trooper
grabbed
him
and
shoved
him
roughly
forward
Hey
lemme
go
ow
Look
I
m
not
supposed
Say
I
just
LOVE
your
loincloth
the
announcer
quipped
Ernie
could
hear
the
audience
laughing
He
began
to
feel
terribly
self
conscious
And
what
a
CUTE
little
dog
the
announcer
went
on
Sterno
didn
t
seem
to
be
particularly
bothered
by
the
state
of
affairs
Say
you
got
a
cigar
Why
SURE
The
announcer
handed
him
one
The
audience
chuckled
The
announcer
continued
Well
all
RIGHT
then
Dr
von
Liederkranz
what
are
we
going
to
start
out
with
today
The
Nazi
smiled
theatrically
Vell
Biff
I
tought
I
d
shtart
out
vit
a
liddle
infention
of
mein
own
de
Hot
Vhirling
Corshcrew
He
pulled
out
a
fiendish
looking
device
made
of
glowing
whirling
metal
parts
Without
warning
he
jabbed
Captain
Memory
with
it
The
Captain
let
out
a
blood
curdling
shriek
The
audience
applauded
wildly
VERY
good
The
announcer
exclaimed
jovially
Now
let
s
see
how
that
rated
on
our
applause
meter
A
Well
that
s
Forget
this
shouted
Captain
Memory
JMP
F
Suddenly
Ernie
found
himself
back
on
the
porcelain
sofa
The
TV
was
now
off
Ernie
was
trembling
Wha
what
happened
Captain
Memory
was
rubbing
his
side
ruefully
Oh
I
JUMPed
us
back
here
I
really
didn
t
like
that
Hot
Whirling
Corkscrew
Good
cigar
though
Sterno
added
puffing
away
The
cigar
seemed
to
have
improved
his
disposition
somewhat
I
I
don
t
understand
Ernie
whined
You
know
how
in
a
lot
of
computer
games
there
s
these
little
doors
or
windows
or
something
and
when
you
step
through
them
you
re
on
a
whole
different
level
Captain
Memory
asked
Yeah
Ernie
replied
tentatively
Well
the
Captain
gestured
towards
the
TV
That
s
one
of
them
Ernie
noticed
an
odd
smell
He
glanced
towards
the
floor
The
two
shrivelled
people
were
vibrating
Wisps
of
smoke
seemed
to
be
coming
out
of
their
ears
Oh
I
forgot
said
the
Captain
You
re
never
supposed
to
turn
the
TV
off
on
these
people
Something
bad
happens
I
forget
exactly
what
but
it
s
real
bad
Ernie
continued
to
watch
the
couple
in
horror
The
smoke
was
coming
more
heavily
new
Their
foreheads
seemed
to
be
bulging
What
what
are
we
gonna
do
Ernie
choked
out
Captain
Memory
regarded
his
bare
wrist
carefully
Some
day
I
m
gonna
get
a
watch
he
said
thoughtfully
I
really
think
we
ought
to
do
something
said
Ernie
anxiously
Smoke
was
coming
out
of
