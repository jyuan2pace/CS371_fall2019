began
to
get
that
queasy
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
again
A
look
down
confirmed
his
worst
fears
the
road
was
yellow
brick
I
don
t
think
I
like
this
said
Ernie
warily
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
You
never
like
anything
Ernie
tried
to
explain
Well
you
see
I
know
I
know
Sterno
interrupted
You
have
a
really
bad
feeling
about
this
You
ve
seen
it
all
before
You
think
it
s
a
trap
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Well
yeah
Sterno
sighed
You
know
this
is
all
becoming
really
tiresome
I
do
SO
wish
you
d
find
something
else
to
go
on
about
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Suddenly
he
smiled
broadly
Hey
I
get
it
This
is
all
really
just
a
game
right
Sterno
moaned
Not
THAT
again
Even
Captain
Memory
looked
annoyed
The
Fly
was
confused
Like
what
is
this
guy
talking
about
he
asked
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
just
rolled
his
eyes
upward
and
made
little
spinning
motions
around
his
temple
with
his
forefinger
Oh
wow
the
Fly
went
on
So
is
this
guy
like
crazy
or
what
Well
you
know
how
it
is
Captain
Memory
explained
not
unsympathetically
Some
people
just
don
t
deal
well
with
travel
It
s
too
stressful
for
them
It
upsets
their
systems
Oh
wow
said
the
Fly
compassionately
Poor
guy
Ernie
was
annoyed
Awright
you
guys
knock
it
off
okay
I
mean
enough
is
enough
all
right
Actually
he
thought
there
was
probably
quite
a
bit
of
truth
to
what
Captain
Memory
had
been
saying
The
stress
probably
WAS
upsetting
his
system
However
even
if
he
agreed
with
what
the
Captain
had
to
say
he
resented
his
tone
of
voice
So
like
what
are
we
gonna
do
now
guys
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
Well
the
Captain
began
jovially
I
guess
we
ll
just
have
to
follow
the
DON
T
SAY
IT
Ernie
broke
in
Okay
Just
don
t
say
it
Touchy
touchy
sniffed
Sterno
Captain
Memory
was
somewhat
taken
aback
Well
have
it
your
way
Let
s
go
that
way
He
gestured
down
the
road
The
Fly
shook
his
head
I
shoulda
known
Anybody
who
d
wear
a
loincloth
like
that
He
noticed
Ernie
glaring
at
him
and
stopped
Hey
no
offense
He
shrugged
Ernie
scowled
They
began
walking
down
the
road
Ernie
peered
ahead
Far
ahead
down
the
road
he
seemed
to
see
something
large
and
green
Big
and
green
Ernie
thought
Is
that
the
Emerald
Suddenly
Ernie
had
an
idea
He
stopped
clicked
his
heels
together
three
times
clenched
his
eyes
tightly
shut
and
said
There
s
no
place
like
home
There
s
no
place
like
home
There
s
no
place
like
home
He
opened
his
eyes
The
other
three
were
standing
around
him
staring
What
is
WRONG
with
you
Sterno
demanded
Ernie
was
acutely
aware
of
everyone
watching
him
I
m
having
a
bad
day
okay
he
said
defensively
Just
leave
me
alone
He
began
walking
forward
again
quickly
My
aren
t
we
sensitive
today
Sterno
said
snidely
The
Fly
shook
his
head
sadly
The
human
mind
is
such
a
fragile
thing
They
proceeded
down
the
road
The
green
object
in
the
distance
began
to
resolve
itself
into
some
kind
of
building
Ernie
continued
to
be
very
unhappy
about
the
entire
situation
but
decided
he
was
sick
of
being
made
fun
of
and
said
nothing
They
approached
the
green
building
It
was
done
in
Greek
revival
style
with
huge
Classical
columns
in
the
front
Hey
it
s
a
bank
noticed
the
Fly
Do
you
suppose
I
can
cash
a
check
The
letters
carved
into
the
Greek
style
pediment
of
the
building
did
in
fact
identify
it
as
a
bank
Ernie
was
confused
He
hadn
t
expected
to
find
a
bank
here
Why
would
there
be
a
bank
here
Ernie
asked
incredulously
Captain
Memory
regarded
the
building
Looks
like
we
might
have
run
into
a
piece
of
somebody
s
business
program
Accounting
or
bank
operations
or
something
He
shook
his
head
That
s
what
happens
when
you
start
sticking
a
bunch
of
unrelated
systems
together
You
never
know
WHAT
you
re
going
to
wind
up
with
They
proceeded
up
the
long
marble
stairway
and
entered
the
bank
The
interior
was
huge
and
very
ornate
done
in
Victorian
style
Everything
seemed
antique
as
though
the
bank
were
right
out
of
the
th
century
They
walked
up
to
a
row
of
teller
s
windows
each
of
which
was
protected
by
elaborate
Victorian
grillwork
The
Fly
pulled
a
very
nice
quality
leather
checkbook
out
of
his
suit
pocket
Hey
he
said
to
the
teller
a
rather
prim
looking
young
woman
Can
you
cash
a
check
I
m
sorry
we
can
t
She
didn
t
really
seem
to
be
sorry
at
all
We
can
t
do
anything
right
now
Our
computers
are
down
Ernie
looked
around
He
saw
men
at
high
desks
carefully
copying
numbers
with
long
quill
pens
Nowhere
was
there
any
sign
of
electricity
much
less
computers
You
don
t
have
any
computers
Ernie
said
suspiciously
The
teller
s
expression
turned
ugly
Well
we
re
still
not
going
to
cash
your
check
she
snapped
Why
not
The
Fly
wanted
to
know
We
can
t
do
any
business
Our
our
accountant
has
gone
crazy
she
concluded
