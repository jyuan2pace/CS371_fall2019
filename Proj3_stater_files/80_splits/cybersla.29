Even
Waldo
can
t
keep
track
of
it
It
s
taking
all
his
computing
power
just
to
keep
the
system
halfway
organized
so
it
doesn
t
crash
You
know
how
hard
it
is
to
keep
a
FATAL
ERROR
from
creeping
into
this
stuff
It
s
only
because
he
s
got
a
multiple
redundant
neural
net
system
that
he
can
keep
this
stuff
running
at
all
Ernie
moaned
He
didn
t
like
the
sound
of
that
FATAL
ERROR
business
One
thing
bothers
me
though
the
Captain
continued
watching
the
military
vehicles
go
by
These
Nazis
They
re
showing
up
way
too
often
They
may
be
somehow
picking
up
our
trail
You
mean
Waldo
Stadium
knows
where
we
are
Ernie
cried
anxiously
He
s
zeroing
in
on
us
Could
be
said
the
Captain
thoughtfully
It
doesn
t
seem
like
they
know
exactly
where
we
are
but
it
does
seem
like
they
know
we
re
around
here
somewhere
I
wonder
how
they
know
that
Ernie
sighed
again
He
would
have
to
remember
not
to
ask
for
explanations
anymore
They
just
made
things
worse
After
a
few
minutes
the
last
of
the
military
vehicles
passed
taking
with
it
the
last
of
the
huge
cloud
of
dust
Ernie
coughed
He
and
the
others
were
all
covered
with
a
thick
layer
of
dirt
He
looked
at
himself
All
the
sparkle
was
gone
from
his
toreador
suit
Sterno
shook
himself
vigorously
sending
dust
flying
in
all
directions
Hey
watch
it
the
Fly
complained
That
stuff
gets
in
my
eyes
you
know
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
How
come
you
re
not
covered
with
dirt
he
demanded
Oh
it
s
the
suit
Captain
Memory
explained
fingering
his
comic
book
character
outfit
It
s
got
that
dirt
repelling
stuff
you
know
the
kind
you
put
in
the
dryer
Ernie
examined
his
toreador
outfit
On
the
inside
he
found
a
small
tag
Just
my
luck
Ernie
thought
Dry
Clean
Only
They
made
their
way
back
on
to
the
road
and
continued
in
the
same
direction
they
had
been
heading
before
the
convoy
went
by
A
light
breeze
sprang
up
and
carried
away
the
worst
of
the
dust
After
walking
for
a
few
minutes
Ernie
noticed
a
house
in
the
distance
As
they
approached
Ernie
could
see
that
it
was
an
elaborate
Victorian
cottage
covered
with
gingerbread
style
ornamentation
Hey
let
s
stop
in
the
Fly
suggested
Maybe
we
can
get
a
drink
of
water
All
this
dust
is
really
buggin
me
Oh
it
s
bugging
you
asked
Sterno
maliciously
Yeah
the
Fly
answered
ingenuously
Sterno
shrugged
There
was
no
point
in
sniping
at
people
who
were
too
dense
to
understand
it
As
they
neared
the
cottage
Ernie
noticed
that
it
was
surrounded
by
a
white
picket
fence
However
a
large
section
of
the
fence
had
been
knocked
over
The
lawn
seemed
to
be
all
chewed
up
as
though
by
the
treads
of
a
tank
Heading
up
the
front
walk
Ernie
noticed
the
door
was
broken
off
it
s
hinges
As
they
climbed
the
porch
Ernie
noticed
that
the
gingerbread
on
the
cottage
was
actual
gingerbread
the
edible
kind
Ernie
broke
off
a
piece
and
sniffed
it
It
seemed
fresh
He
took
a
bite
Very
tasty
he
thought
He
suddenly
realized
that
he
hadn
t
had
anything
to
eat
for
a
really
long
time
The
shutters
looked
interesting
they
had
frosting
and
raisins
Oh
wow
what
happened
here
Ernie
heard
the
Fly
ask
He
looked
through
the
door
Inside
were
obvious
signs
of
a
struggle
The
quaint
German
style
furniture
was
scattered
about
The
walls
were
pockmarked
with
bullet
holes
On
one
side
of
the
room
was
a
large
cast
iron
stove
Next
to
the
stove
stood
a
large
cage
with
its
door
open
The
stove
was
red
hot
and
a
bad
smell
came
from
it
Captain
Memory
considered
the
scene
and
regarded
the
tank
tracks
and
bullet
holes
Looks
like
whoever
was
here
got
arrested
by
the
Nazis
he
commented
Ernie
thought
about
this
Hansel
and
Gretel
arrested
by
the
Nazis
But
then
again
Hansel
and
Gretel
is
a
German
story
isn
t
it
In
that
case
Ernie
decided
it
s
none
of
my
business
I
won
t
worry
about
it
Instead
he
decided
to
look
for
something
else
to
eat
Ernie
found
an
old
fashioned
icebox
which
seemed
to
be
full
of
pies
cakes
and
other
goodies
There
didn
t
seem
to
be
anything
by
way
of
regular
wholesome
food
though
Oh
well
thought
Ernie
cutting
into
a
Bavarian
Black
Forest
Torte
I
guess
I
ll
just
have
to
rough
it
Sterno
was
helping
himself
to
an
eclair
Very
nice
he
commented
Would
you
mind
handing
me
a
piece
of
that
double
chocolate
rum
cheesecake
Hey
this
is
good
stuff
the
Fly
added
vacuuming
up
a
dish
of
frosted
ginger
snaps
through
his
long
snout
Ernie
stopped
Hey
how
do
we
know
this
stuff
is
okay
I
mean
maybe
this
is
an
alien
trap
or
something
Maybe
this
stuff
is
poisoned
Sterno
sniffed
disgustedly
We
can
always
count
on
you
to
say
something
utterly
inappropriate
at
the
table
can
t
we
Comments
like
that
can
ruin
everyone
s
appetite
The
first
decent
thing
we
ve
had
to
eat
on
this
entire
ridiculous
escapade
and
you
have
