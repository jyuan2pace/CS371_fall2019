to
make
it
out
more
clearly
It
looked
like
well
it
looked
like
an
overly
large
Plymouth
taxi
It
had
huge
fins
two
tone
paint
and
rather
a
lot
of
rust
Captain
Memory
gestured
proudly
towards
it
as
it
came
in
for
a
landing
There
it
is
guys
he
announced
proudly
The
Luna
C
Ain
t
she
a
beauty
Sterno
glanced
behind
them
The
sounds
of
commotion
back
on
the
trail
were
increasing
Not
a
moment
too
soon
he
muttered
Ernie
watched
the
Luna
C
as
it
approached
for
a
landing
He
noticed
that
it
seemed
to
be
coming
in
rather
fast
With
a
deafening
crash
the
Luna
C
slammed
into
the
ground
throwing
a
cloud
of
dust
and
dirt
in
all
directions
As
the
dust
settled
Ernie
noticed
a
hubcap
rolling
listlessly
away
finally
coming
to
a
stop
by
a
nearby
tree
Captain
Memory
winced
but
then
quickly
regained
his
composure
He
started
towards
the
spacecraft
The
driver
s
side
door
of
the
Luna
C
opened
and
a
lanky
individual
with
long
unkempt
hair
got
out
He
was
wearing
a
loud
Hawaiian
shirt
and
dark
sunglasses
even
though
it
was
night
He
waved
at
Captain
Memory
Hey
dude
what
s
happenin
Hey
Ralph
Captain
Memory
waved
cheerily
at
the
driver
This
is
my
pilot
Ralph
he
introduced
the
man
to
the
group
as
they
all
sprinted
towards
the
spacecraft
Sterno
eyed
the
Luna
C
suspiciously
This
is
your
ship
That
s
it
Captain
Memory
waved
at
it
proudly
Then
how
come
it
says
Taxi
on
it
Sterno
asked
pointedly
Captain
Memory
s
face
fell
Well
well
I
was
supposed
to
get
a
limo
Well
they
told
me
I
could
have
a
limo
but
there
was
this
budget
problem
Anyway
I
could
ve
had
a
company
car
for
sure
except
um
there
was
that
problem
about
my
license
So
anyway
He
trailed
off
uncomfortably
So
you
hadda
take
a
cab
Sterno
finished
for
him
Well
well
Flustered
Captain
Memory
broke
off
Yeah
Ernie
noticed
that
the
sounds
behind
them
were
getting
awfully
close
Uh
could
we
talk
about
this
someplace
else
Captain
Memory
glanced
back
down
the
trail
You
re
right
He
turned
to
Ralph
Let
s
cruise
Ralph
looked
uncomfortable
Uh
I
wanted
to
tell
you
dude
We
got
a
little
problem
Let
s
talk
about
it
on
the
way
he
suggested
glancing
back
down
the
trail
The
guys
around
here
are
um
uncool
Ralph
nodded
understandingly
I
can
dig
it
He
got
into
the
driver
s
seat
while
the
other
four
piled
into
the
roomy
back
seat
Ralph
shifted
into
Fly
and
stomped
on
the
accelerator
The
Luna
C
instantly
shot
thirty
feet
straight
up
into
the
air
violently
flipped
upside
down
and
hung
there
unmoving
Ernie
Sterno
and
the
Fly
suddenly
found
themselves
upside
down
in
a
very
uncomfortable
position
laying
halfway
on
the
roof
and
halfway
in
their
seats
Captain
Memory
and
Ralph
however
were
sitting
quite
comfortably
in
their
seats
as
though
glued
into
them
So
like
I
was
saying
dude
Ralph
went
on
conversationally
We
got
this
little
problem
In
the
position
he
was
in
Ernie
could
see
the
ground
beneath
them
quite
clearly
through
the
Luna
C
s
large
rear
window
Their
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
commotion
taking
place
The
probing
searchlights
and
the
bobbing
torches
seemed
to
have
come
together
Ernie
heard
shouts
screams
machine
gun
fire
Then
all
was
silent
After
a
few
moments
the
drums
and
chanting
began
again
Oom
alla
boom
Oom
alla
BOOM
Ernie
could
see
a
fire
being
lit
beneath
the
huge
iron
pot
It
looked
as
though
the
Cannibals
were
going
to
have
their
feast
after
all
Ernie
s
attention
returned
to
the
conversation
inside
the
space
taxi
Ralph
was
telling
his
story
animatedly
so
I
wired
the
framistatter
to
the
quark
generator
Ralph
could
see
that
Captain
Memory
was
about
to
say
something
but
he
cut
him
off
Yeah
I
know
you
re
not
supposed
to
do
it
I
know
Warning
Do
Not
Bypass
Overload
Protection
Who
listens
to
that
crap
So
anyway
it
really
kicked
up
the
horsepower
you
know
what
I
mean
And
when
the
light
turned
green
man
I
was
outta
there
Those
guys
in
the
Vette
man
they
couldn
t
believe
it
You
shoulda
seen
their
faces
It
was
So
what
happened
Captain
Memory
interrupted
Ralph
became
suddenly
subdued
Okay
so
maybe
the
left
rear
antimatter
coupler
got
toasted
It
s
no
biggie
We
ll
stop
at
the
parts
store
we
ll
pick
up
a
new
one
It
s
just
a
couple
bucks
It
was
worth
it
You
shoulda
seen
those
guys
faces
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
I
got
some
bad
news
for
you
Ralph
The
parts
store
s
closed
Oh
MAN
Ralph
was
annoyed
You
mean
we
re
gonna
have
to
hang
out
until
the
store
opens
What
a
drag
Ralph
shook
his
head
unhappily
So
like
when
does
it
open
Captain
Memory
regarded
his
wrist
carefully
Let
s
see
it
s
right
now
So
I
would
say
it
ll
probably
open
in
about
oh
two
billion
years
Oh
MAN
Ralph
was
really
upset
I
can
t
wait
two
billion
years
I
got
a
date
on
Friday
Ernie
whimpered
Does
that
mean
the
