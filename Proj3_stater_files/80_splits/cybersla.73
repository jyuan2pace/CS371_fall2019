s
paranoia
was
making
him
imagine
something
else
Ernie
just
didn
t
know
anymore
I
remember
breaking
out
of
an
egg
The
Fly
was
talking
now
He
too
seemed
to
be
in
a
daze
Oh
wow
thought
Ernie
The
Fly
must
have
been
watching
while
the
doctor
hypnotized
Captain
Memory
Now
he
s
hypnotized
too
The
psychiatrist
glared
at
the
Fly
Quiet
please
The
Fly
paid
no
attention
He
kept
on
talking
A
larva
That
s
it
I
m
a
larva
The
doctor
attempted
to
coax
more
from
Captain
Memory
Now
go
back
The
Fly
broke
in
again
I
m
a
larva
and
I
m
on
a
nice
warm
pile
of
garbage
Yes
The
psychiatrist
cursed
under
his
breath
He
turned
to
the
Fly
Wake
up
He
snapped
his
fingers
in
front
of
the
Fly
s
face
Both
the
Fly
and
Captain
Memory
awoke
instantly
The
Fly
put
his
hands
up
to
his
head
Oh
wow
he
said
uncertainly
I
must
have
dozed
off
Captain
Memory
yawned
That
s
funny
So
did
I
And
I
ve
been
having
the
strangest
dreams
The
doctor
turned
to
Captain
Memory
with
keen
interest
Zo
tell
me
about
zese
dreams
Captain
Memory
scratched
his
head
Well
I
was
in
Ancient
Egypt
and
I
He
trailed
off
Please
go
on
the
psychiatrist
urged
The
Captain
looked
confused
That
s
all
I
can
remember
The
doctor
cursed
again
He
suddenly
became
aware
that
Ernie
was
watching
him
He
cleared
his
throat
and
regained
his
composure
Zo
he
began
Now
ve
give
ze
other
patients
a
turn
The
doctor
turned
to
one
of
the
patients
that
had
been
in
the
room
when
the
foursome
arrived
the
depressed
looking
man
who
kept
wringing
his
hands
Why
don
t
you
tell
us
your
name
and
vhat
has
brought
you
to
see
us
today
The
other
patient
looked
somehow
familiar
to
Ernie
Vell
doctor
my
name
is
Holger
Horses
Und
mein
problem
vell
it
s
mein
job
He
continued
to
look
steadfastly
at
the
floor
never
once
looking
up
at
the
others
around
him
Ernie
thought
it
was
very
odd
that
this
patient
too
had
a
German
accent
But
then
on
the
other
hand
perhaps
he
was
just
being
paranoid
The
patient
went
on
Mein
boss
he
is
so
demanding
If
I
make
even
one
liddle
mistake
he
hits
me
vith
his
riding
crop
Und
if
I
don
t
make
any
mistake
he
hits
me
anyway
He
sniffled
He
seemed
about
to
cry
It
makes
me
feel
so
inadequate
There
there
said
the
doctor
commiseratingly
handing
the
man
a
handkerchief
The
man
blew
his
nose
noisily
I
mean
it
s
not
mein
fault
dat
they
keep
getting
avay
Ve
lock
them
up
good
But
somehow
dey
get
out
and
I
get
blamed
He
sniffled
Vhy
do
dey
keep
doing
dis
to
me
All
ve
vant
to
do
is
torture
dem
a
liddle
Oh
ja
ja
the
psychiatrist
said
compassionately
Ze
vorkplace
is
so
demanding
dese
days
I
understand
exactly
how
you
feel
Do
you
doctor
The
man
looked
up
hopefully
pleadingly
at
the
psychiatrist
Does
dat
mean
you
von
t
hit
me
vith
the
riding
crop
any
more
Dummkopf
the
psychiatrist
hissed
The
man
caught
his
breath
suddenly
and
looked
quickly
back
down
at
the
floor
He
began
to
moan
quietly
again
The
doctor
laughed
nervously
Vell
uh
perhaps
ve
had
best
go
on
to
ze
next
patient
He
turned
to
the
other
man
the
one
who
continuously
lit
matches
Und
your
name
sir
Vell
Herr
Doktor
mein
name
ist
Horst
Manure
the
man
continued
to
light
matches
as
he
talked
It
seemed
very
odd
to
Ernie
that
this
patient
too
spoke
with
a
German
accent
I
zee
said
the
psychiatrist
Und
vhen
did
you
first
notice
zis
fascination
vith
fire
The
patient
giggled
Vell
it
shtarted
vhen
Rome
burned
Flames
everywhere
The
whole
city
in
flames
People
running
screaming
It
was
chust
SO
much
fun
He
stared
fixedly
as
the
match
slowly
burned
down
to
his
fingertips
Ernie
couldn
t
help
interrupting
Wait
a
minute
How
could
you
be
old
enough
to
be
in
Rome
when
it
burned
The
patient
looked
taken
aback
He
looked
quickly
at
the
doctor
The
doctor
seemed
very
uncomfortable
Uh
um
ze
time
machine
Oh
yes
he
use
ze
time
machine
What
s
he
doing
with
a
time
machine
anyway
Ernie
demanded
The
psychiatrist
quickly
regained
his
poise
He
peered
at
Ernie
Zo
do
you
haff
zese
attacks
of
paranoia
often
Ernie
was
caught
off
guard
Um
uh
yes
Uh
I
mean
NO
He
was
becoming
very
confused
The
psychiatrist
nodded
knowingly
I
zee
Ernie
pouted
I
think
there
s
something
pretty
suspicious
about
this
whole
business
Of
course
you
do
Sterno
puffed
contentedly
on
his
cigar
You
re
paranoid
No
I
m
Ernie
began
Sterno
continued
cutting
Ernie
off
You
know
I
ve
always
suspected
as
much
But
now
that
we
have
the
doctor
s
diagnosis
we
know
for
sure
Something
occurred
to
Ernie
You
suspected
as
much
Yes
all
along
Sterno
maintained
smugly
Well
if
you
re
suspecting
things
than
maybe
YOU
RE
the
paranoid
Ernie
cried
out
triumphantly
Sterno
harrumphed
I
don
t
think
that
s
The
Fly
cut
him
off
Oh
I
get
it
