noticed
that
sequins
had
been
falling
off
his
suit
all
along
leaving
a
sparkly
trail
as
he
walked
Oh
great
he
thought
Now
on
top
of
everything
else
my
suit
is
shedding
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
I
guess
it
must
be
just
about
time
for
the
Eggplant
Uprising
he
commented
The
what
Ernie
was
confused
as
usual
Oh
come
on
The
Captain
was
annoyed
Don
t
you
pay
attention
to
anything
I
tell
you
You
know
the
Revolt
of
the
Vegetables
the
Purple
Menace
remember
when
they
nuked
us
back
to
the
Stone
Age
Oh
sure
Ernie
remembered
being
nuked
well
enough
He
had
some
vague
recollection
of
the
other
stuff
too
He
decided
to
pretend
he
remembered
the
rest
of
it
as
well
since
he
was
tired
of
being
picked
on
for
not
paying
attention
So
uh
what
about
it
Well
anyway
the
Captain
went
on
After
the
Great
Traffic
Jam
The
what
Ernie
broke
in
involuntarily
Oh
you
re
right
said
the
Captain
slightly
abashed
I
didn
t
tell
you
about
that
The
Great
Traffic
Jam
took
place
because
of
this
problem
they
had
due
to
chronic
over
production
of
cars
You
see
they
just
kept
building
all
these
cars
and
people
kept
buying
them
just
for
the
heck
of
it
even
though
they
didn
t
have
anyplace
to
go
in
them
Well
of
course
it
had
to
happen
one
particularly
nice
summer
day
everybody
decided
to
go
for
a
drive
all
at
the
same
time
They
wound
up
bumper
to
bumper
coast
to
coast
The
entire
country
was
tied
up
in
total
gridlock
People
didn
t
know
what
to
do
they
didn
t
know
how
to
get
around
without
their
cars
anymore
It
was
terrible
there
was
mass
starvation
Thousands
died
vultures
picked
their
bones
through
their
convertible
tops
Well
I
m
sure
you
can
see
that
under
circumstances
like
these
people
were
in
no
mood
for
a
practical
joke
Uh
right
Ernie
thought
he
d
just
agree
and
maybe
the
Captain
would
go
on
with
the
story
without
noticing
that
Ernie
wasn
t
following
the
story
at
all
Ernie
was
lucky
The
Captain
continued
Well
you
can
imagine
how
people
felt
when
rumors
began
to
fly
about
certain
species
of
giant
plants
that
had
escaped
from
the
atomic
testing
laboratories
and
had
grown
to
enormous
size
by
feasting
on
human
flesh
And
how
these
plants
were
determined
to
get
revenge
on
the
entire
animal
kingdom
for
the
millions
of
years
of
abuse
they
and
their
plant
brothers
had
had
to
put
up
with
at
the
hands
and
paws
and
muzzles
and
so
on
of
non
vegetable
life
forms
Ernie
furled
his
brow
Does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Vegetable
Rights
Movement
You
got
it
agreed
Captain
Memory
Ernie
felt
a
sinking
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
In
spite
of
himself
he
WAS
beginning
to
remember
all
this
He
didn
t
WANT
to
remember
it
because
if
he
remembered
it
that
meant
Ernie
didn
t
want
to
think
about
what
that
meant
Anyway
the
Captain
continued
They
were
going
to
organize
all
the
vegetables
stage
a
massive
uprising
and
eliminate
all
animal
life
for
ever
On
top
of
all
this
these
plants
were
invulnerable
to
conventional
weapons
and
could
only
be
destroyed
by
the
atomic
fires
that
had
created
them
Small
wonder
then
that
general
panic
broke
out
when
something
very
large
and
very
purple
raised
it
s
leafy
head
over
the
city
of
Chicago
Captain
Memory
chuckled
Oh
wow
said
Ernie
This
was
really
creepy
It
was
a
lot
like
telling
ghost
stories
around
the
campfire
at
camp
So
it
was
a
giant
man
eating
eggplant
Don
t
be
silly
How
could
there
be
a
such
a
thing
as
a
giant
man
eating
eggplant
Captain
Memory
was
amused
No
it
was
just
practical
joke
It
was
that
zany
Andreas
Labyrinth
and
his
band
of
merry
pranksters
up
to
their
little
games
again
Captain
Memory
chortled
I
still
remember
that
phony
Russian
invasion
That
was
really
a
riot
Or
how
about
that
bogus
epidemic
That
had
everybody
in
stitches
Something
about
that
explanation
didn
t
seem
quite
right
to
Ernie
but
he
wasn
t
in
the
mood
to
try
to
figure
out
what
it
was
He
wanted
to
hear
the
rest
of
Captain
Memory
s
story
So
then
what
happened
uh
will
happen
uh
so
what
about
the
Eggplant
Well
as
I
was
saying
Captain
Memory
always
enjoyed
telling
stories
It
wasn
t
really
a
giant
Eggplant
it
was
really
just
a
big
purple
balloon
But
it
looked
a
lot
like
a
giant
eggplant
you
know
big
scary
face
painted
on
it
and
all
I
suppose
in
saner
times
people
might
have
questioned
the
whole
thing
a
little
more
closely
After
all
there
wasn
t
really
any
proof
that
it
was
a
giant
eggplant
It
could
have
been
a
giant
grape
No
reason
to
nuke
a
giant
grape
is
there
I
guess
not
Ernie
supposed
he
might
as
well
agree
since
he
couldn
t
think
of
any
reason
on
Earth
to
nuke
a
giant
grape
But
people
just
didn
t
stop
and
think
the
Captain
went
on
They
just
went
ahead
and
dropped
the
bomb
And
when
