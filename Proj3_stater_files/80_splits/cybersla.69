around
them
Ernie
could
see
nothing
around
him
but
dense
underbrush
All
he
could
see
ahead
of
him
was
Captain
Memory
s
back
He
supposed
that
he
didn
t
have
much
alternative
except
to
just
keep
moving
along
the
trail
At
least
the
sound
of
the
jungle
drums
was
diminishing
Ernie
began
to
be
aware
of
a
sound
in
the
distance
A
sort
of
whooshing
sound
It
sounded
almost
like
distant
traffic
noises
He
considered
it
It
was
probably
just
the
wind
in
the
trees
he
decided
Captain
Memory
stopped
abruptly
causing
Ernie
to
just
about
pile
into
his
back
Hmm
he
said
peering
intently
forward
You
can
get
through
that
opening
right
there
the
Fly
s
voice
came
from
behind
As
usual
his
hyper
acute
vision
had
spotted
details
which
everyone
else
missed
Captain
Memory
pushed
through
a
narrow
gap
in
the
bushes
The
others
followed
Pushing
through
the
dense
brush
Ernie
emerged
on
to
a
clearing
No
it
was
a
lawn
A
big
mowed
lawn
About
fifty
yards
ahead
was
a
large
parking
lot
followed
by
a
huge
chrome
and
glass
office
building
In
the
distance
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
major
highway
from
which
Ernie
could
hear
what
were
indeed
traffic
sounds
HEY
A
gruff
voice
interrupted
them
Huh
Ernie
looked
around
confusedly
Get
outta
da
flower
bed
Ernie
looked
down
He
was
standing
on
top
of
a
dozen
beautiful
but
crushed
tulips
NOW
the
voice
demanded
Ernie
rushed
forward
onto
the
grass
destroying
dozens
more
beautiful
flowers
in
the
process
Ernie
looked
back
to
see
the
rest
of
the
group
carefully
picking
their
way
forward
through
the
flowers
careful
not
to
cause
any
more
damage
Ernie
looked
up
to
see
the
owner
of
the
gruff
voice
approaching
He
was
a
short
heavy
set
man
in
coveralls
smoking
a
cigar
He
appeared
to
be
the
groundskeeper
He
glanced
at
the
group
and
singled
out
Ernie
Look
whatcha
did
to
my
flowers
Whatsa
matter
with
you
kids
anyway
You
wanna
use
the
Park
you
follow
the
rules
You
stay
on
the
trail
you
don
t
go
walking
through
the
flower
beds
Park
Ernie
was
uncomprehending
Poodawumpus
Park
the
gardener
repeated
insistently
What
you
just
came
outta
You
stay
on
the
trail
you
follow
the
signs
you
don
t
be
tearin
up
the
bushes
He
glared
at
the
entire
group
Um
we
didn
t
see
any
signs
the
Fly
said
carefully
Aaah
the
damn
kids
tore
up
the
signs
again
Little
brats
I
ll
kill
em
The
groundskeeper
chomped
his
cigar
angrily
Um
there
were
these
natives
Ernie
began
uncertainly
Yeah
o
course
there
s
natives
It
s
a
nature
park
There

natural
natives
in
it
He
looked
at
Ernie
suspiciously
You
didn
t
feed
the
natives
didja
No
no
Ernie
protested
We
didn
t
even
get
near
em
Good
The
groundskeeper
seemed
slightly
placated
They
eat
what
s
not
on
their
diet
it
makes
em
sick
He
continued
to
regard
the
group
suspiciously
You
didn
t
leave
no
junk
in
there
didja
Damn
kids
party
in
there
on
weekends

the
trail
fulla
junk

He
glared
accusingly
at
the
foursome
No
no
Ernie
protested
We
re
real
neat
We
never
litter
We
don
t
allow
no
dogs
on
the
trail
neither
He
glared
at
Sterno
Sign
says
so
right
at
da
entrance
Um
we
didn
t
see
the
Fly
began
Yeah
yeah
I
know
Damn

Awright

dis
time
but
next
time
I
swear

cops
We
re
real
sorry
Ernie
began
edging
away
It
won
t
happen
again
The
group
started
moving
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
office
building
Yeah
yeah
the
groundskeeper
was
looking
ruefully
at
his
crushed
flowers
The
Fly
shook
his
head
Boy
is
he
gonna
be
mad
when
he
finds
the
Luna
Sssh
Sterno
warned
What
the
groundskeeper
turned
back
to
them
Uh
have
a
nice
day
Ernie
said
quickly
Good
bye
He
waved
cheerfully
and
started
walking
quickly
towards
the
office
building
The
others
followed
Ernie
was
confused
Why
is
there
an
office
building
here
he
asked
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
Looks
like
it
s
somebody
s
architecture
program
I
ve
heard
of
that
Sterno
commented
The
architects
model
a
building
in
Virtual
Reality
so
that
the
clients
can
see
if
they
like
it
or
not
before
it
s
actually
built
Well
we
might
as
well
take
a
look
at
their
handiwork
the
Captain
decided
The
continued
over
the
large
parking
lot
that
lay
in
front
of
them
It
was
almost
empty
only
an
occasional
car
was
parked
here
and
there
They
soon
reached
the
doors
of
the
building
and
entered
In
front
of
them
lay
a
small
utilitarian
lobby
typical
of
cheaply
constructed
office
buildings
In
the
center
of
the
lobby
was
a
booth
marked
Information
but
there
was
no
one
manning
it
Most
of
the
offices
appeared
to
be
closed
On
the
wall
was
a
directory
to
the
offices
in
the
building
which
the
Fly
was
reading
carefully
Mostly
lawyers
he
said
ruefully
We
may
need
a
lawyer
after
all
the
damage
HE
s
caused
Sterno
said
looking
