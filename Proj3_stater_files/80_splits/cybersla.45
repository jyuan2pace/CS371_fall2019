was
pointedly
looking
in
another
direction
The
Fly
was
talking
to
Mr
Ed
Ernie
was
wearily
cradling
his
head
in
his
hands
No
one
seemed
to
be
greeting
the
Captain
s
announcement
with
much
enthusiasm
Of
course
I
could
be
wrong
The
Captain
said
tentatively
No
one
answered
Ernie
began
examining
the
coffee
maker
He
wasn
t
quite
sure
how
to
work
an
old
model
like
this
He
turned
it
over
There
seemed
to
be
some
directions
on
the
bottom
but
the
were
all
covered
with
coffee
stains
and
were
practically
impossible
to
read
He
would
probably
just
have
to
figure
it
out
himself
Wait
a
minute
The
Captain
said
urgently
Ernie
looked
up
Now
what
It
just
occurred
to
me
that
uh
Captain
Memory
looked
embarrassed
Maybe
the
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
doesn
t
make
coffee
after
all
So
what
does
it
do
instead
Make
tea
Um
no
The
Captain
looked
uncomfortable
I
think
it
uh
destroys
planets
Ernie
gave
the
Captain
a
disgusted
look
There
uh
isn
t
any
place
to
put
peanut
butter
in
that
thing
is
there
the
Captain
asked
intensely
Ernie
examined
it
No
Nothing
about
peanut
butter
No
little
door
or
compartment
or
anything
Ernie
looked
it
over
Nope
The
Captain
seemed
relieved
Okay
okay
Forget
that
Forget
I
said
anything
about
peanut
butter
I
m
absolutely
sure
that
it
uh
destroys
planets
Or
makes
coffee
It
for
sure
either
destroys
planets
or
makes
coffee
Captain
Memory
beamed
pleased
with
himself
for
having
solved
this
difficult
problem
Ernie
examined
the
machine
more
closely
There
was
a
lever
on
the
top
which
was
labelled
Mild
on
one
side
and
Full
on
the
other
He
also
found
a
two
position
switch
on
the
side
There
were
little
words
printed
next
to
each
position
Unfortunately
the
ink
had
rubbed
off
of
them
and
they
were
very
difficult
to
read
Ernie
peered
closely
He
wasn
t
sure
but
the
positions
seemed
to
be
labelled
Brew
and
Destroy
Ernie
sighed
He
was
rapidly
losing
interest
in
the
entire
subject
Idly
he
flipped
the
switch
Instantly
the
earth
rumbled
the
building
shook
Ernie
hastily
flipped
the
switch
back
again
Sterno
turned
to
Ernie
irritatedly
Who
did
that
Did
you
do
that
Uh
yeah
I
Well
you
could
at
least
excuse
yourself
Sterno
snapped
Oh
Sorry
Somehow
Ernie
always
seemed
to
wind
up
feeling
that
he
was
at
fault
Captain
Memory
was
beaming
Well
that
settles
that
doesn
t
it
It
destroys
planets
I
was
right
all
along
Of
course
I
was
Ernie
regarded
the
device
ruefully
He
noticed
a
small
faded
tag
on
the
side
which
read
WARNING
Follow
instructions
carefully
The
manufacturer
assumes
no
responsibility
for
damage
to
planets
due
to
failure
to
follow
said
instructions
Such
failure
will
also
void
your
warranty
Ernie
sighed
There
goes
my
cup
of
coffee
Captain
Memory
returned
to
consulting
his
TV
Guide
An
object
on
the
coffee
table
caught
Ernie
s
attention
It
was
a
small
rectangular
object
wrapped
in
paper
He
picked
it
up
It
seemed
to
be
a
candy
bar
Ernie
s
stomach
started
grumbling
again
He
was
feeling
very
sorry
for
himself
at
the
moment
He
hadn
t
had
anything
to
eat
for
a
very
long
time
How
come
everybody
else
got
to
eat
but
not
him
He
couldn
t
even
get
a
cup
of
coffee
He
unwrapped
the
object
It
looked
like
a
candy
bar
It
smelled
like
a
candy
bar
A
wave
of
guilt
suddenly
came
over
him
He
probably
shouldn
t
eat
it
It
probably
belonged
to
Captain
Memory
But
then
on
the
other
hand
maybe
it
had
been
on
the
coffee
table
all
along
and
he
just
hadn
t
noticed
it
Ernie
brightened
In
any
case
that
sounded
like
a
good
excuse
to
him
He
took
a
bite
Quite
tasty
although
it
did
have
an
odd
crunch
He
ate
the
rest
of
the
bar
and
tossed
the
wrapper
under
the
sofa
Ernie
was
beginning
to
feel
somewhat
better
Suddenly
the
telephone
rang
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
Captain
Memory
looked
at
Ernie
Well
the
Captain
demanded
Uh
the
telephone
s
ringing
said
Ernie
uncomfortably
Are
you
going
to
answer
it
the
Captain
wanted
to
know
Um
you
want
me
to
answer
it
Well
it
s
on
your
side
It
was
indeed
sitting
on
an
end
table
right
next
to
Ernie
I
thought
they
didn
t
have
telephones
in
ancient
Rome
said
Ernie
uneasily
For
god
s
sake
answer
the
telephone
already
cried
Sterno
That
ringing
is
driving
me
crazy
Ernie
picked
up
the
phone
Yo
cried
the
voice
on
the
other
end
Ernie
Ross
right
Uh
yeah
answered
Ernie
uneasily
He
wasn
t
expecting
to
get
any
calls
in
ancient
Rome
Dis
is

little
matter

Well

Ernie
began
desperately
You

Vito
interrupted
It
