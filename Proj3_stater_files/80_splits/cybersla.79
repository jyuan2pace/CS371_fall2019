is
great
he
enthused
I
ve
got
my
looks
back
The
babes
are
gonna
love
it
Awright
It
s
time
to
PA
A
A
RTY
Ernie
looked
around
thoughtfully
There
wasn
t
much
to
see
All
that
was
left
of
the
planet
Earth
was
the
little
patch
of
ground
that
they
stood
on
What
s
what
s
going
to
happen
to
us
now
Well
Captain
Memory
scratched
his
head
I
guess
we
ll
all
be
going
home
Sterno
put
a
paw
over
his
stomach
I
I
feel
very
strange
he
complained
I
Suddenly
Sterno
shimmered
and
disappeared
Ernie
was
aghast
Oh
my
god
he
s
gone
What
happened
to
him
It
s
beginning
Captain
Memory
replied
calmly
We
re
all
going
back
to
our
proper
place
and
time
the
Captain
hesitated
wherever
that
is
We
re
going
back
the
Fly
was
enthusiastic
AWRIGHT
He
too
had
begun
to
shimmer
He
flashed
Ernie
the
thumbs
up
sign
It
s
PARTY
TIME
With
that
he
was
gone
Now
there
was
only
Ernie
and
Captain
Memory
But
but
what
should
I
do
when
I
get
back
Ernie
wanted
to
know
I
mean
after
all
this
shouldn
t
I
I
dunno
DO
something
Captain
Memory
shrugged
I
guess
you
ll
just
have
to
wait
and
see
Suddenly
Ernie
felt
ill
The
world
began
to
shimmer
around
him
The
Captain
s
shape
was
becoming
vague
and
indistinct
The
last
thing
Ernie
saw
was
the
Captain
gazing
ruefully
at
his
bare
wrist
I
sure
wish
I
could
have
gotten
a
watch
though
he
said
sadly
With
that
the
scene
vanished
EPILOGUE
Ernie
s
head
swan
The
strange
distorted
shapes
of
a
surreal
landscape
swirled
around
him
He
stumbled
backwards
and
his
hand
fell
upon
a
doorknob
Reflexively
he
pulled
it
open
and
stepped
through
A
bright
fluorescent
light
dazzled
his
eyes
He
became
aware
of
the
sound
of
many
voices
in
the
distance
He
staggered
forward
All
done
A
girl
s
voice
startled
Ernie
He
looked
up
He
was
back
at
the
Arcade
Did
you
have
a
nice
game
the
girl
at
the
information
booth
was
asking
him
twirling
a
finger
through
her
hair
absent
mindedly
Uh
Ernie
could
only
mumble
HowEVER
did
you
get
that
loincloth
so
dirty
she
reproved
cracking
her
chewing
gum
loudly
There
s
a
five
dollar
cleaning
fee
for
that
you
know
Ernie
s
mind
was
slowly
clearing
Uh
yeah
he
managed
to
answer
You
can
change
in
there
the
girl
pointed
to
a
dressing
room
When
you
return
the
loincloth
and
the
broadsword
you
ll
get
your
deposit
back
she
looked
at
him
pointedly
Minus
the
five
dollar
cleaning
fee
As
Ernie
changed
his
mind
began
to
clear
Putting
his
own
clothes
on
again
made
him
feel
almost
normal
Had
all
of
this
really
happened
or
had
it
all
been
just
an
illusion
Maybe
it
was
all
just
a
malfunctioning
computer
program
Ernie
couldn
t
be
sure
Ernie
walked
slowly
home
from
the
Arcade
trying
to
put
his
mind
in
order
He
looked
carefully
at
everything
he
passed
For
some
reason
it
seemed
to
him
that
things
would
be
somehow
different
Yet
the
neighborhood
looked
about
the
same
as
far
as
he
could
tell
But
then
again
he
d
never
really
paid
that
much
attention
to
all
the
details
Some
of
them
might
be
different
and
he
d
never
even
notice
After
what
seemed
a
very
long
time
he
approached
his
own
house
He
examined
it
carefully
It
looked
the
same
as
far
as
he
could
tell
He
took
a
deep
breath
and
went
inside
Hello
dear
he
heard
his
mother
s
voice
come
from
the
kitchen
Did
you
have
a
nice
game
Uh
I
guess
he
called
out
in
reply
It
was
uh
different
That
s
nice
his
mother
answered
Dinner
s
ready
Ernie
walked
into
the
dining
room
He
was
still
feeling
pretty
woozy
Maybe
something
to
eat
would
make
him
feel
better
Ernie
s
mother
entered
carrying
a
large
covered
dish
Ernie
gasped
Mom
Your
hair
Ernie
s
mother
looked
confused
What
about
my
hair
It
it
s
green
Ernie
choked
But
it
s
always
been
green
his
mother
was
puzzled
Are
you
feeling
all
right
dear
boy
Ernie
collapsed
into
a
chair
No
he
moaned
I
don
t
feel
good
at
all
It
must
be
that
awful
Virtual
Reality
Game
his
mother
said
knowingly
I
ve
always
said
those
things
were
unhealthy
It
s
just
too
much
stimulation
for
young
minds
Uh
yeah
Ernie
agreed
pitifully
Have
some
dinner
and
you
ll
feel
better
she
said
wisely
dishing
out
a
plate
of
food
for
Ernie
I
ve
made
your
favorite
squid
with
mothballs
Uh
Ernie
began
Your
favorite
TV
show
s
on
tonight
his
mother
continued
cheerily
I
Wanna
Donna
with
Donna
the
Iguana
In
fact
she
went
on
brightly
All
your
favorite
Reptiles
are
on
tonight
Ernie
sighed
deeply
Well
he
thought
It
looks
like
I
m
home
Sort
of
THE
END
