antennae
perked
up
The
Frug
The
Jerk
The
Mashed
Potato
he
suggested
The
Swim
Sterno
added
Or
even
The
TWIST
A
brilliant
idea
occurred
to
Ernie
I
know
This
must
be
The
Land
of
Dances
Sterno
turned
to
Ernie
with
a
look
of
utter
disgust
Look
we
ve
been
through
this
before
remember
Fondue
chocolate
watches
Heidi
remember
Ernie
became
subdued
You
re
trying
to
tell
me
this
is
Switzerland
right
The
Fly
s
antennae
twitched
excitedly
Oh
I
remember
that
now
Land
of
Dances
That
was
a
song
by
Cannibal
and
the
Headhunters
Cannibal
Ernie
started
He
thought
for
a
moment
On
the
other
hand
he
went
on
Switzerland
is
fine
Chocolate
Heidi
Fine
just
fine
Well
Sterno
sniffed
I
m
glad
THAT
S
settled
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
wrist
Watches
Did
you
say
watches
Ernie
looked
at
the
sheep
He
noticed
that
each
of
them
wore
rather
a
nice
Swiss
watch
on
one
of
their
front
forelegs
Captain
Memory
continued
to
look
at
his
bare
wrist
and
sighed
Oh
dear
I
m
afraid
it
s
getting
late
We
ll
have
to
be
going
Ernie
was
nonplussed
Aren
t
we
supposed
to
like
help
them
overthrow
the
evil
ruler
or
something
Captain
Memory
shrugged
It
s
not
my
problem
you
know
I
mean
we
can
t
do
everything
Baa
Baa
said
the
lead
sheep
insistently
The
sheep
wants
to
know
Sterno
translated
If
you
can
t
help
overthrow
the
Wooly
Bully
could
you
at
least
give
him
some
clue
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
his
daughter
She
s
been
missing
since
yesterday
and
he
s
afraid
something
terrible
might
have
happened
to
her
the
poor
little
lamb
Ernie
burped
Everyone
turned
to
look
at
him
Uh
who
me
I
don
t
know
anything
about
it
Why
would
I
know
anything
about
it
He
fidgeted
uncomfortably
compulsively
wiping
his
still
greasy
hands
on
his
fur
loincloth
Stop
looking
at
me
like
that
I
think
we
d
better
get
going
said
Captain
Memory
decisively
Now
The
four
turned
to
leave
Ernie
looked
back
at
the
group
of
sheep
He
smiled
weakly
trying
to
think
of
something
nice
to
say
in
Sheepish
Ba
he
waved
good
bye
The
lead
sheep
started
and
rose
up
on
his
hind
legs
looking
very
angry
and
offended
That
was
very
rude
Sterno
reproved
Ernie
Uh
what
did
I
say
asked
Ernie
bewildered
I
only
meant
After
ALL
Sterno
continued
You
ve
never
even
met
his
mother
And
even
if
you
had
I
seriously
doubt
she
would
have
consented
to
do
anything
like
that
with
YOU
Gee
I
m
sorry
I
Ernie
decided
that
perhaps
the
safest
thing
to
do
was
simply
be
quiet
The
four
continued
walking
Ernie
noticed
that
it
seemed
to
be
getting
warmer
Substantially
more
humid
too
Even
though
he
was
wearing
only
a
loincloth
Ernie
began
to
perspire
The
others
also
seemed
to
be
feeling
uncomfortable
from
the
heat
All
except
Captain
Memory
who
never
seemed
to
be
uncomfortable
at
all
As
the
sun
began
to
set
Ernie
noticed
that
the
vegetation
around
them
was
different
now
The
warm
area
they
were
heading
into
seemed
to
full
of
tropical
plants
Lush
flowers
and
tall
trees
loomed
ahead
of
them
In
fact
they
seemed
to
heading
into
a
jungle
Ernie
noticed
an
object
lying
in
the
grass
It
appeared
to
be
the
broken
remnants
of
a
vandalized
sign
of
some
sort
Ernie
could
just
barely
make
out
a
few
words
through
the
layers
of
graffiti
Pooda
something
Ernie
read
No
alcoholic
beverages
allowed
Do
not
feed
the
The
rest
was
gone
Something
about
it
made
Ernie
feel
very
uncomfortable
Um
is
it
really
a
good
idea
to
be
heading
into
the
jungle
at
night
Ernie
asked
nervously
Oh
you
re
right
said
Sterno
sarcastically
Let
s
just
check
into
a
Holiday
Inn
instead
Well
it
s
just
that
it
s
awfully
well
dark
Ernie
fidgeted
It
gets
that
way
at
night
Sterno
pointed
out
You
know
of
some
way
to
prevent
it
perhaps
Ernie
eyed
the
thick
jungle
vegetation
ahead
of
them
with
misgivings
What
if
there
s
um
hostile
natives
or
something
At
that
exact
moment
drums
began
pounding
in
the
distance
Ernie
began
to
feel
very
uneasy
Do
we
have
to
go
in
there
he
pleaded
No
not
at
all
Captain
Memory
pointed
out
We
can
just
stay
here
and
wait
for
the
Nazis
to
catch
up
with
us
if
you
like
Ernie
moaned
No
that
s
okay
Let
s
just
keep
going
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
I
dunno
nothing
seems
to
make
you
happy
You
don
t
want
to
go
you
don
t
want
to
stay
You
know
you
really
need
to
have
a
more
positive
attitude
Yeah
right
Ernie
grunted
They
continued
along
the
way
into
the
jungle
The
vegetation
seemed
to
swallow
them
up
The
heavy
masses
of
green
foliage
on
all
sides
seemed
to
offer
little
possibility
of
escape
The
continued
along
the
trail
which
became
ever
narrower
as
they
progressed
Look
the
Fly
pointed
ahead
It
was
now
almost
night
The
jungle
before
them
was
almost
pitch
black
However
off
to
the
left
small
points
of
light
could
be
seen
weaving
and
bobbing
in
and
out
of
the
foliage
in
