want
to
hear
this
Captain
Memory
looked
very
unhappy
It
s
uh
I
know
I
know
The
Fly
was
totally
involved
with
the
game
Carmen
Miranda
It
s
Carmen
Miranda
right
Captain
Memory
sighed
It
s
well
it
s
TOTAL
SYSTEM
FAILURE
The
Fly
was
totally
taken
aback
Huh
Sister
Failure
Who
s
she
He
sulked
It
s
not
fair
to
use
people
who
aren
t
famous
How
am
I
supposed
to
guess
that
What
movies
has
she
been
in
anyway
Ernie
sighed
with
relief
System
Failure
Well
that
wasn
t
that
bad
He
frowned
It
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
feel
differently
if
he
had
any
idea
what
a
system
failure
was
What
he
started
to
say
then
stopped
On
second
thought
perhaps
he
d
rather
not
know
What
in
the
world
is
a
total
system
failure
supposed
to
be
Sterno
demanded
irritatedly
Captain
Memory
sighed
That
s
when
you
totally
exceed
the
operating
parameters
of
the
system
to
the
point
where
not
even
the
multiple
redundant
neural
net
backups
can
compensate
for
it
any
more
Huh
Ernie
wasn
t
following
that
Well
Captain
Memory
simplified
It
s
sort
of
like
the
system
has
a
heart
attack
Ernie
thought
about
that
And
if
the
system
has
a
heart
attack
Then
WE
have
a
heart
attack
Sterno
finished
for
him
Ernie
moaned
quietly
He
d
had
a
feeling
it
was
going
to
be
something
like
this
Why
did
they
have
to
tell
him
this
anyway
What
was
he
Ernie
supposed
to
do
about
it
What
did
they
have
to
tell
him
if
there
wasn
t
anything
he
could
do
about
it
His
stomach
hurt
He
decided
to
try
to
think
about
something
else
Their
path
was
now
blocked
by
the
herd
forcing
the
foursome
to
cool
their
heels
and
wait
for
the
animals
to
pass
They
waited
while
thousands
of
cattle
went
by
raising
a
huge
cloud
of
choking
dust
Finally
the
herd
passed
and
the
four
continued
on
their
way
They
walked
for
what
once
again
seemed
a
very
long
time
finding
nothing
Finally
the
Fly
noticed
something
Seems
to
be
something
going
on
up
ahead
he
commented
Looks
like
a
chariot
pulled
over
by
the
side
of
the
road
As
the
foursome
approached
they
could
see
that
it
indeed
was
a
chariot
Four
Romans
in
togas
stood
around
it
A
tire
on
one
of
the
wheels
seemed
to
have
gone
flat
and
they
were
pumping
it
up
with
a
hand
pump
Ernie
frowned
Are
chariots
supposed
to
have
tires
The
Fly
looked
at
the
chariot
Hey
it
s
got
old
fashioned
skinny
tires
on
spoked
wheels
like
a
Model
T
Ford
What
do
you
expect
I
dunno
Ernie
was
trying
hard
to
remember
what
the
chariots
looked
like
in
the
gladiator
movies
however
he
hadn
t
been
paying
attention
that
closely
With
all
the
stuff
that
s
been
happening
you
can
t
be
too
careful
Don
t
be
such
a
worry
wart
snapped
Sterno
Suppose
it
IS
a
phony
chariot
what
difference
does
it
make
Uh
Ernie
hadn
t
thought
that
far
ahead
His
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
one
of
the
Romans
who
approached
them
He
was
a
tall
thin
man
wearing
a
toga
He
seemed
like
a
typical
Roman
out
of
a
gladiator
movie
except
for
the
fact
that
he
wore
a
monocle
and
jackboots
The
man
s
arm
swept
out
in
a
Roman
salute
Heil
I
mean
Hail
he
said
cheerfully
Ernie
frowned
Weren
t
Romans
supposed
to
wear
sandals
The
man
continued
Ve
chust
finished
fixing
our
chariot
Perhaps
you
vould
like
a
ride
ja
You
bet
said
the
Fly
enthusiastically
Boy
I
m
really
sick
of
walking
Well
I
dunno
said
Ernie
Something
about
this
just
didn
t
seem
right
to
him
He
looked
at
the
two
white
horses
that
the
chariot
was
hitched
to
carefully
examining
them
for
any
sign
of
seams
or
lumpiness
No
they
looked
okay
Perfectly
formed
with
no
seams
One
thing
did
seem
odd
about
them
though
they
didn
t
move
at
all
They
stood
absolutely
still
like
statues
But
then
on
the
other
hand
Ernie
didn
t
really
know
that
much
about
horses
Maybe
they
were
supposed
to
stand
like
that
It
probably
didn
t
mean
anything
Oh
come
ON
said
Sterno
impatiently
Quit
making
such
an
issue
about
everything
Let
s
just
get
in
all
right
I
ve
had
it
with
walking
I
bet
you
must
be
dog
tired
right
said
the
Fly
Spare
me
your
attempts
at
humor
you
insectile
moron
Sterno
barked
The
Fly
looked
upset
What
did
he
mean
by
that
he
said
to
Ernie
Time
to
go
urged
the
Roman
All
aboard
ja
Sterno
and
the
Fly
quickly
scrambled
aboard
the
chariot
which
seemed
unusually
large
and
spacious
to
Ernie
He
got
on
as
well
in
spite
of
his
misgivings
Captain
Memory
brought
up
the
rear
The
other
three
Romans
then
got
on
behind
them
blocking
the
entrance
and
making
any
escape
impossible
Ernie
felt
very
uneasy
about
that
He
was
however
relieved
to
see
that
Captain
Memory
did
not
seem
the
least
bit
bothered
by
the
situation
But
then
Captain
Memory
didn
t
seem
the
least
bit
bothered
by
ANY
situation
Vell
avay
we
go

the
