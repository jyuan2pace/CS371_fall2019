is
powerful
Ernie
carefully
peered
over
the
brink
He
tried
to
see
the
bottom
of
the
crater
but
he
couldn
t
see
a
thing
No
wait
a
minute
He
did
see
something
he
saw
stars
How
could
there
be
stars
at
the
bottom
of
a
hole
The
Fly
peeked
over
the
edge
as
well
Whew
That
s
some
big
hole
you
blew
there
buddy
Ernie
continued
to
peer
into
the
hole
trying
to
make
some
sense
out
of
what
he
saw
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Um
how
far
down
does
that
hole
go
anyway
The
Captain
shook
his
head
sadly
All
the
way
Huh
Ernie
was
uncomprehending
All
the
way
to
where
China
Captain
Memory
continued
to
peer
downward
Further
than
that
From
the
look
of
it
I
d
say
just
about
all
the
way
to
Mars
The
Captain
shook
his
head
sadly
You
know
you
really
should
read
the
directions
to
those
things
before
you
use
them
Ernie
looked
at
the
coffee
maker
in
dismay
He
placed
the
it
carefully
in
the
sand
and
gingerly
edged
away
from
it
Hey
this
is
really
cool
the
Fly
continued
to
look
over
the
rim
I
can
see
stars
looking
down
he
looked
up
AND
looking
up
He
peered
over
the
opposite
edge
Hey
there
s
stars
on
all
sides
Neat
How
did
you
do
that
Sterno
stared
at
Ernie
his
eyes
widening
in
horror
You
didn
t
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
He
did
What
demanded
Ernie
What
did
I
do
Sterno
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
shock
You
mean
that
one
little
device
could
Captain
Memory
nodded
dismally
I
m
afraid
so
WHAT
Ernie
was
becoming
very
agitated
Sterno
glared
balefully
at
Ernie
How
could
you
DO
such
a
thing
Will
somebody
please
tell
me
what
I
did
Ernie
wailed
Captain
Memory
sighed
Well
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
You
see
this
little
patch
of
ground
we
re
standing
on
That
s
all
that
s
left
All
that
s
left
of
what
Ernie
wasn
t
following
this
at
all
Of
the
planet
Earth
the
Captain
declared
morosely
WHAT
Ernie
was
horrified
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
dejectedly
I
m
afraid
you
blew
just
about
the
entire
planet
away
Everything
except
the
little
patch
we
re
standing
on
He
peeked
over
the
edge
Looks
like
you
nailed
the
moon
too
But
But
Ernie
protested
weakly
How
could
that
HAPPEN
The
Captain
sighed
I
told
you
that
thing
was
powerful
He
continued
peering
over
the
edge
Something
caught
his
eye
He
brightened
Ah
good
That
s
a
relief
What
Ernie
was
desperate
for
any
good
news
Captain
Memory
smiled
You
ll
be
glad
to
know
that
Mars
is
fine
The
blast
didn
t
even
touch
it
He
peered
more
closely
It
might
be
a
little
off
it
s
orbit
but
aside
from
that
it
s
perfectly
okay
Ernie
moaned
Suddenly
Captain
Memory
straightened
up
He
began
looking
in
all
directions
a
look
of
consternation
on
his
face
Something
s
happening
Sterno
glared
at
Ernie
This
is
all
your
fault
The
Fly
put
his
hands
up
to
his
head
Oh
wow
My
head
It
s
What
s
happening
to
me
Ernie
s
jaw
dropped
in
amazement
The
Fly
s
head
was
beginning
to
change
As
the
others
watched
in
astonishment
the
Fly
s
head
shimmered
disappeared
and
was
replaced
by
the
perfectly
normal
looking
head
of
a
man
in
his
mid
s
Whoo
complained
the
Fly
I
feel
really
weird
He
squinted
There
s
something
wrong
with
my
eyes
I
can
t
see
too
good
anymore
You
re
you
re
normal
Ernie
gasped
in
astonishment
The
Fly
put
his
hands
up
to
his
head
feeling
out
it
s
shape
Oh
wow
It
s
my
old
head
I
got
it
back
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
is
helpless
astonishment
What
s
happening
Captain
Memory
too
looked
amazed
It
s
the
game
We
ve
ended
the
game
Of
course
Sterno
caught
his
drift
immediately
By
destroying
most
of
the
world
you
ve
brought
the
game
to
an
end
There
s
not
enough
of
the
planet
left
to
play
with
Right
Captain
Memory
beamed
And
you
ve
done
it
within
the
logical
confines
of
the
program
Using
materials
found
within
the
program
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
program
s
logic
Captain
Memory
reached
out
to
shake
Ernie
s
hand
Good
job
Sterno
looked
ruefully
over
the
edge
of
the
chasm
Of
course
I
don
t
think
we
got
very
many
points
It
doesn
t
matter
said
Captain
Memory
cheerfully
It
s
Game
Over
That
s
all
we
need
Ernie
was
finding
this
all
difficult
to
follow
So
now
what
Now
the
system
shuts
down
in
an
orderly
manner
and
we
re
all
free
cried
the
Captain
jubilantly
The
evil
genius
Waldo
Stadium
is
thwarted
his
Cyberslaves
are
set
free
We
win
Ernie
s
eyes
narrowed
You
talk
about
all
of
this
almost
as
if
it
was
a
game
Captain
Memory
seemed
taken
aback
Did
I
he
said
innocently
Well
I
m
sure
I
didn
t
mean
to
He
trailed
off
Meanwhile
the
Fly
was
engrossed
in
examining
his
head
He
had
pulled
out
a
small
pocket
mirror
and
was
looking
himself
over
carefully
Hey
this
