audience
was
staring
at
Ernie
They
seemed
to
be
expecting
something
He
smiled
and
waved
half
heartedly
The
audience
tittered
and
applauded
weakly
Ernie
noticed
that
the
audience
was
still
made
up
entirely
of
Nazis
He
sighed
He
might
have
known
he
would
wind
up
back
here
he
thought
Whatever
the
worst
thing
is
that
could
possibly
happen
that
s
what
will
happen
Ernie
frowned
In
fact
this
was
even
the
worst
thing
that
couldn
t
possibly
happen
and
it
was
happening
anyway
Wasn
t
that
against
Murphy
s
Law
or
something
Anyway
it
was
all
very
confusing
Von
Liederkranz
turned
to
the
other
side
of
the
stage
Ernie
noticed
that
the
aliens
had
been
transported
onto
the
game
show
as
well
and
were
now
staggering
and
blinking
just
like
Ernie
Und
tonight
ve
have
vith
us
special
guests
von
Liederkranz
said
gesturing
towards
the
aliens
with
his
riding
crop
Lucy
and
Ricky
Ricardo
the
famous
Cuban
bandleader
and
their
friends
Fred
and
Ethel
Mertz
Thunderous
applause
greeted
the
introduction
The
aliens
were
utterly
confused
Chick
a
boom
asked
Ricky
shaking
his
maracas
feebly
The
Mertz
s
drew
alien
weapons
pointing
them
in
all
directions
uncertainly
Und
now
ze
big
question
von
Liederkranz
said
to
the
aliens
Vill
you
take
vot
s
in
dis
bag
he
held
up
a
small
paper
bag
which
looked
a
lot
like
somebody
s
lunch
Or
try
for
vot
s
behind
door
number
four
The
audience
was
hushed
with
anticipation
The
aliens
looked
at
each
other
in
confusion
What
do
we
do
I
wasn
t
prepared
for
this
I
don
t
know
what
to
do
they
told
each
other
Captain
Memory
decided
to
help
them
out
Anyone
with
any
BRAINS
would
take
what
s
behind
door
number
four
he
hinted
The
aliens
brightened
Brains
Brains
Yes
that
s
it
Let
s
take
what
s
behind
door
number
four
They
looked
pleased
Chick
a
BOOM
said
Ricky
definitely
Door
number
four
it
is
called
out
von
Liederkranz
The
audience
roared
it
s
approval
An
attractive
woman
in
a
chorus
girl
outfit
opened
door
number
four
and
the
aliens
filed
in
looking
very
pleased
As
soon
as
the
last
alien
was
inside
the
door
slammed
with
a
metallic
crash
The
chorus
girl
reached
over
and
daintily
locked
it
Immediately
Ernie
began
to
hear
the
sounds
of
commotion
coming
from
behind
the
door
At
first
pounding
then
thuds
then
shrill
blood
curdling
screams
The
screams
continued
for
several
minutes
and
then
died
away
Finally
all
was
silent
behind
door
number
four
The
audience
applauded
Vell
von
Liederkranz
announced
jovially
Looks
like

He
laughed
He
turned
to
Ernie
Captain
Memory
and
the
others
Ernie
noticed
that
while
their
attention
had
been
drawn
elsewhere
guards
with
machine
guns
had
surrounded
them
Shtill
it
vas
very
considerate
of
dem
to
find
you
for
me
he
said
with
an
evil
gleam
in
his
eye
I

incident

Blaster
Von
Liederkranz
turned
to
the
guard
nearest
him
for
vhich
YOU

He
lashed
the
guard
with
his
riding
crop
But
Herr
Doktor
the
guard
protested
I
vasn
t
even
there
Shut

von
Liederkranz
snapped
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Und
now
perhaps

He
smiled
sadistically
You

Vis

Hot

Corkscrew
A
guard
handed
von
Liederkranz
the
by
now
familiar
diabolical
looking
device
which
began
to
glow
and
whirl
Von
Liederkranz
smiled
evilly
He
began
slowly
advancing
toward
Captain
Memory
with
his
device
Von
Liederkranz
was
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
a
knock
He
looked
around
There
it
was
again
someone
was
knocking
on
the
stage
door
Von
Liederkranz
was
annoyed
Answer
ze
door
dummkopf
he
snapped
at
one
of
the
guards
The
guard
opened
the
door
Mailman
A
fellow
in
a
post
office
uniform
walked
in
the
door
Got
a
special
delivery
letter
here
Von
Liederkranz
narrowed
his
eyes
suspiciously
For
who
Is
there
a
Mr
Ernest
Ross
here
Uh
that
s
me
Ernie
said
Here
you
go
The
mailman
handed
Ernie
a
letter
Everything
stopped
while
Ernie
opened
the
letter
Von
Liederkranz
and
the
Nazis
milled
about
confusedly
Ernie
was
totally
mystified
Who
could
be
sending
him
a
letter
here
Nobody
knew
he
was
here
and
even
if
they
did
why
would
they
send
him
a
letter
here
Ernie
tore
the
letter
open
and
read

Ross

Ernie
looked
up
Von
Liederkranz
was
watching
him
very
carefully
Ernie
had
an
idea
Oops
looks
like
I
gotta
go
pay
a
bill
See

Ernie
started
towards
the
door
Not
so
fast
Von
Liederkranz
blocked
Ernie
s
path
Give
me
dot
letter
He
snatched
it
out
of
Ernie
s
hand
Der
Sturmbannfuhrer
was
very
upset
