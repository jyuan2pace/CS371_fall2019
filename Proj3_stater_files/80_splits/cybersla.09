be
wrapping
the
show
up
Vell
folks
dis
is
Biff
Mozzarella
saying
Wait
a
minute
Sterno
interrupted
I
think
something
smells
around
here
Captain
Memory
looked
up
Got
a
problem
he
asked
unconcernedly
Think
about
it
Sterno
considered
His
name
Mozzarella
Huh
said
Ernie
You
mean
Biff
This
guy
s
name
is
Mozzarella
Sterno
noted
The
last
guys
name
was
Liederkranz
So
asked
Ernie
uncomprehendingly
Cheese
get
it
cried
Sterno
They
re
both
cheese
I
don
t
think
I
like
the
sound
of
this
Ernie
thought
Um
well
you
know
he
began
to
Captain
Memory
Maybe
we
ought
to
give
this
some
consideration
But
it
was
too
late
With
a
deafening
roar
the
delicate
panel
doors
to
the
room
were
blown
off
their
hinges
A
dozen
armed
men
rushed
in
pointing
wicked
looking
weapons
at
the
trio
FREEZE
one
of
them
shouted
Captain
Memory
looked
uncomprehending
It
seems
a
bit
warm
for
that
he
commented
The
group
of
armed
men
parted
to
make
way
for
an
unpleasant
looking
man
wearing
a
black
military
uniform
jackboots
and
a
monocle
Zo
ve
meet
again
The
man
did
in
fact
look
somewhat
familiar
to
Ernie
Haven
t
I
seen
you
somewhere
before
The
man
smiled
warmly
No
doubt
you
ve
seen
my
TV
show
THE
TORTURE
GAME
is
a
big
hit
these
days
I
m
He
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
Sturmbannfuhrer
Dr
Heinz
von
Liederkranz
the
Gestapo
s
greatest
He
paused
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
applause
His
men
looked
at
each
other
quickly
and
began
clapping
Ernie
thought
it
might
be
a
good
idea
if
he
applauded
too
ENOUGH
Von
Liederkranz
silenced
his
men
with
a
quick
sweep
of
his
riding
crop
leaving
Ernie
applauding
feebly
all
by
himself
Ernie
looked
around
and
quickly
stopped
Von
Liederkranz
prodded
Captain
Memory
in
the
chest
with
his
riding
crop
Now
You
will
tell
us
your
name
rank
and
serial
number
My
what
Captain
Memory
looked
uncomprehending
Your
name
rank
and
serial
number
Name
rank
and
cereal
number
mused
the
Captain
But
I
never
even
eat
cereal
Do
not
be
coy
with
us
snapped
the
Sturmbannfuhrer
We
know
you
are
one
of
Them
Ve
know
you
are
a
spy
on
a
mission
of
sabotage
and
destruction
He
paused
calculatingly
Remember
ve
have
vays
of
making
you
talk
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
in
confusion
Who
are
these
guys
anyway
They
LOOK
like
a
bunch
of
Nazis
the
Captain
replied
thoughtfully
But
they
COULD
be
Enough
von
Liederkranz
broke
in
You
vill
answer
our
questions
Captain
Memory
concentrated
How
about
Who
Put
the
Bop
in
the
Bop
Shu
Bop
Shu
Bop
he
suggested
Von
Liederkranz
s
tone
abruptly
changed
You
know
he
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Ve
do
not
haff
to
be
enemies
Ve
could
be
friends
You
vould
like
to
be
friends
nein
Sure
Captain
Memory
was
nothing
if
not
agreeable
Then
tell
us
vot
ve
vant
to
know
Okay
The
Captain
thought
a
minute
The
attack
is
set
for
exactly
Julius
Caesar
will
march
on
Omaha
and
the
Enterprise
will
attack
the
Titanic
somewhere
in
the
South
China
Sea
Then
Patton
will
drive
up
through
the
south
of
France
make
a
right
onto
Route
go
down
three
stop
lights
turn
right
and
it
s
the
third
house
from
the
corner
Just
as
ve
thought
This
of
course
was
not
what
the
Sturmbannfuhrer
had
thought
at
all
However
he
had
to
maintain
a
good
appearance
in
front
of
his
men
He
smiled
amiably
Please
go
on
Captain
Memory
decided
it
was
time
to
stop
I
think
I
ve
said
too
much
already
Von
Liederkranz
s
face
turned
hard
You
misunderstand
he
said
menacingly
I
m
not
asking
you
I
m
TELLING
YOU
TALK
NOW
I
d
really
rather
not
Captain
Memory
didn
t
seem
to
be
too
upset
by
the
proceedings
Ernie
however
was
beginning
to
sweat
Sterno
was
glaring
at
the
other
two
giving
them
an
I
told
you
so
look
Von
Liederkranz
smiled
sadistically
You

t
escape

Ve

of

Captain
Memory
began
I

cried
von
Liederkranz
If

Captain
Memory
looked
pained
You
know
I
really
don
t
care
for
the
Hot
Vhirling
I
mean
Whirling
Corkscrew
Von
Liederkranz
laughed
sadistically
You

Ve

few
hours
vit

Captain
Memory
seemed
offended
Well
if
you

going
to
be

that
I
m
simply
going
to
have

leave
Von
Liederkranz
laughed
sadistically
again
In
fact
he
didn
t
seem
to
be
able
to
laugh
any
other
way
Dere
is
no
way
out
von
Liederkranz
continued
You
cannot
break
into
ze
system
from
here
Ernie
noticed
his
stomach
beginning
to
hurt
again
Stress
he
thought
It
s
not
good
for
me
to
be
under
this
much
stress
I
think
it
s
affecting
my
health
Maybe
I
m
getting
an
ulcer
Von
Liederkranz
switched
on
his
Hot
