turns
out
we
need
it
after
all
we
ll
get
back
to
you
okay
Uh
yeah
Ernie
fidgeted
uncomfortably
He
had
hoped
that
the
problem
would
go
away
completely
but
that
seemed
to
be
too
much
to
expect
At
least
he
didn
t
have
to
worry
about
it
right
now
Lucy
opened
the
door
to
the
time
machine
She
waved
at
the
foursome
See
you
uh
later
Uh
earlier
She
looked
confused
She
turned
to
Ricky
Bye
he
said
and
ushered
Lucy
into
the
machine
The
door
closed
behind
them
Captain
Memory
yawned
He
was
finding
this
all
rather
boring
I
wonder
what
s
on
TV
he
mused
pulling
out
the
TV
guide
A
look
of
concern
came
over
his
face
Ernie
noticed
this
What
s
the
matter
It
s
the
programs
the
Captain
said
looking
distressed
They
ve
um
changed
Changed
Ernie
was
uncomprehending
Changed
how
Well
for
instance
the
Captain
explained
Instead
of
I
Love
Lucy
there
s
now
I
Wanna
Donna
starring
Donna
the
Iguana
and
her
husband
Ricky
the
Reptile
In
fact
Captain
Memory
flipped
through
the
pages
quickly
They
all
seem
to
be
Reptile
shows
Ernie
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
Oh
no
Now
instead
of
them
having
to
watch
our
shows
we
have
to
watch
THEIR
shows
Cm
continued
calmly
perusing
the
TV
Guide
Aside
from
that
they
re
pretty
much
the
same
The
plots
seem
to
be
about
the
same
He
chuckled
Oh
look
Here
s
the
episode
where
Ricky
Jr
hatches
Sterno
seemed
lost
in
thought
That
reptile
lady
s
name
wasn
t
really
Lucy
was
it
he
asked
the
psychiatrist
Oh
no
agreed
the
doctor
Dat
s
only
her
stage
name
Sterno
s
eyes
narrowed
Her
real
name
wouldn
t
by
any
chance
happen
to
be
He
paused
for
effect
DONNA
would
it
He
watched
the
psychiatrist
closely
The
doctor
fidgeted
uncomfortably
Uh
I
m
um
not
allowed
to
divulge
personal
information
about
Sterno
cut
him
off
Just
as
we
thought
Sterno
puffed
his
cigar
contemplatively
You
know
some
people
will
do
anything
to
get
into
show
biz
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
worriedly
I
don
t
know
if
I
m
going
to
like
watching
Reptile
shows
all
the
time
The
psychiatrist
regained
his
composure
Vith
every
successful
therapy
there
is
always
a
period
of
readjustment
for
ze
family
In
time
you
vill
learn
to
deal
vith
dis
new
situation
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Und
you
must
be
ze
one
vis
ze
amnesia
problem
The
Captain
looked
up
Who
me
Dat
s
right
the
psychiatrist
looked
at
him
intently
You
have
ze
amnesia
ja
Captain
Memory
looked
confused
Not
that
I
recall
Chust
as
ve
thought
the
doctor
said
triumphantly
scribbling
furiously
on
his
notepad
All
of
this
was
making
Ernie
very
uncomfortable
Hey
guys
he
whispered
to
the
others
I
think
maybe
we
ought
to
get
going
What
IS
your
problem
said
Sterno
loudly
Um
uh
Everyone
was
looking
at
Ernie
He
didn
t
know
what
to
say
The
Fly
looked
puzzled
Is
something
the
matter
Oh
don
t
pay
any
attention
to
him
scoffed
Sterno
gesturing
in
Ernie
s
direction
He
s
just
paranoid
I
am
not
said
Ernie
defensively
The
Fly
seemed
confused
Paranoids
never
admit
they
re
paranoid
explained
Sterno
Please
please
gentlemen
the
psychiatrist
broke
in
Ve
must
return
to
ze
topic
Everyone
vill
get
his
turn
to
speak
He
tuned
to
Ernie
reassuringly
Ve
must
not
allow
our
paranoia
to
carry
us
away
ja
He
smiled
It
seemed
to
Ernie
that
the
smile
wasn
t
very
friendly
But
then
he
thought
that
s
what
a
paranoid
would
think
Could
it
be
that
the
doctor
was
right
and
that
he
Ernie
had
become
paranoid
Ernie
didn
t
know
what
to
think
any
more
Zo
the
doctor
turned
again
to
Captain
Memory
You
vere
telling
us
about
your
computer
hacking
activities
ja
I
was
The
Captain
looked
puzzled
I
don
t
recall
that
Ernie
s
eyes
narrowed
He
didn
t
recall
that
either
Ja
ja
the
psychiatrist
said
reassuringly
Amnesia
is
a
terrible
thing
Ve
must
begin
your
therapy
right
avay
He
pulled
out
a
gold
pocket
watch
on
the
end
of
a
long
chain
and
began
swinging
it
slowly
back
and
forth
in
front
of
Captain
Memory
Vatch
de
vatch
he
whispered
to
the
Captain
Now
go
back
back
Vhat
do
you
remember
Captain
Memory
seemed
to
be
completely
hypnotized
It
s
it
s
so
confusing
Images
numbers
it
s
space
yes
Cyberspace
And
it
s
all
filled
with
strange
images
Games
pictures
old
movies
and
TV
shows
They
re
all
coming
at
me
All
at
the
same
time
They
re
filling
my
head
They
re
taking
over
my
brain
The
Captain
was
becoming
very
agitated
Relax
calm
yourself
the
psychiatrist
whispered
The
Captain
seemed
calmer
now
Go
back
further
back
Vhat
do
you
see
The
Captain
seemed
to
be
in
a
daze
Pyramids
Pharaohs
No
no
the
psychiatrist
protested
Not
THAT
far
back
I
knew
it
Ernie
broke
in
Ancient
Egypt
Please
the
doctor
snapped
glaring
at
Ernie
Do
not
interrupt
Your
time
vill
come
He
smiled
evilly
Or
on
the
other
hand
perhaps
Ernie
only
imagined
that
he
smiled
evilly
Maybe
he
was
really
trying
to
help
and
Ernie
