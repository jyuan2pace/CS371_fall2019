it
s
Ralph
Ernie
could
only
hear
Ralph
s
side
of
the
conversation
Ralph
seemed
upset
Look
Stella
don
t
start
up
with
me
okay
I
m
having
a
bad
day
okay
Look
it
wasn
t
my
fault
Anyway
I
gotta
talk
to
the
boss
is
he
Oh
no
Stella
don
t
put
me
on
Suddenly
Ralph
froze
into
immobility
Ernie
peered
at
him
Ralph
was
absolutely
motionless
like
a
statue
He
didn
t
even
seem
to
be
breathing
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
What
happened
to
Ralph
Captain
Memory
seemed
unconcerned
Oh
they
put
him
on
hold
On
Hold
Ernie
was
uncomprehending
Captain
Memory
shrugged
Well
you
know
they
always
do
that
when
you
want
to
talk
to
the
boss
You
can
t
expect
him
to
drop
everything
just
to
talk
to
YOU
can
you
The
Captain
chuckled
at
the
thought
Ernie
peered
at
Ralph
He
s
not
breathing
No
he
doesn
t
need
to
He
s
in
suspended
animation
the
Captain
explained
yawning
and
stretching
That
way
you
re
not
aware
of
how
much
time
has
passed
while
you
re
waiting
for
your
connection
Ernie
frowned
I
don
t
think
I
d
like
that
Captain
Memory
shrugged
I
guess
they
feel
it
s
kinder
that
way
he
conjectured
Kinder
Ernie
was
having
a
hard
time
with
all
of
this
It
s
either
that
or
Muzak
Sterno
explained
Oh
Ernie
considered
this
Yeah
I
guess
suspended
animation
would
be
better
He
looked
over
at
Ralph
So
how
long
is
he
gonna
be
like
that
Let
me
see
Captain
Memory
examined
his
bare
wrist
closely
It
s
ten
o
clock
now
so
I
d
say
oh
about
two
billion
years
Two
billion
years
Ernie
was
aghast
Look
at
the
bright
side
Captain
Memory
went
on
cheerfully
By
then
the
parts
store
will
be
open
Ernie
moaned
What
are
we
supposed
to
do
in
the
meantime
Captain
Memory
frowned
Good
point
We
can
t
very
well
sit
around
here
can
we
He
chuckled
Might
as
well
hit
the
road
He
opened
the
car
door
and
flipped
himself
neatly
around
from
his
current
sitting
position
which
was
of
course
upside
down
relative
to
the
others
and
landed
neatly
on
his
feet
on
the
ground
outside
He
turned
to
Ernie
Coming
Ernie
crawled
painfully
out
through
the
open
car
door
and
struggled
to
his
feet
on
the
ground
outside
The
group
assembled
themselves
outside
the
upside
down
taxi
all
of
them
stretching
and
yawning
Ernie
peered
into
the
interior
of
the
taxi
until
he
spotted
his
coffee
maker
which
he
carefully
retrieved
He
stood
up
beside
the
taxi
and
looked
about
confusedly
Sterno
seemed
to
have
regained
his
composure
more
quickly
than
the
other
members
of
the
group
What
is
this
Office
that
you
and
Ralph
were
talking
about
he
asked
Captain
Memory
pointedly
The
Captain
looked
suddenly
uncomfortable
Well
uh
you
know
everybody
s
got
to
work
for
a
living
He
trailed
off
You
mean
you
re
not
a
full
time
Super
Hero
the
Fly
inquired
He
seemed
disappointed
Captain
Memory
shuffled
awkwardly
Well
uh
you
know
Super
Hero
ing
doesn
t
pay
too
good
What
exactly
do
you
do
at
this
Office
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Oh
you
know
a
little
programming
The
Captain
seemed
evasive
Oh
said
Sterno
with
relish
This
is
beginning
to
make
a
lot
more
sense
to
me
now
THAT
S
how
you
manage
to
do
all
these
tricky
things
here
in
Cyberspace
You
re
using
the
Company
computer
You
ve
got
a
mainframe
to
work
with
don
t
you
Well
Captain
Memory
seemed
very
uncomfortable
Sterno
continued
I
bet
you
re
not
running
all
this
from
a
PC
Well
no
the
Captain
admitted
I
got
a
Cray
A
CRAY
Even
Ernie
who
knew
very
little
about
computers
had
heard
of
the
awesome
power
of
a
Cray
Well
it
s
not
mine
personally
you
understand
the
Captain
began
defensively
In
other
words
Sterno
said
reflectively
You
re
using
the
Company
s
Cray
to
break
into
Waldo
Stadium
s
stolen
systems
and
free
the
Cyberslaves
Sterno
s
eyes
narrowed
Aren
t
you
supposed
to
be
doing
something
more
productive
Hey
this
is
important
Captain
Memory
insisted
indignantly
Anyway
it
s
part
of
R
D
you
know
After
all
I
could
He
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
thunderous
BOOM
BOOM
BOOM
of
jungle
drums
A
distant
chanting
reached
their
ears
Ernie
struggled
to
make
it
out
It
seemed
to
be
something
like
Oom
alla
boom
YUM
YUM
YUM
Maybe
we
should
um
get
moving
Ernie
suggested
Uh
sure
The
Captain
agreed
glad
to
change
the
subject
Let
s
go
He
began
striding
purposefully
forward
He
walked
right
up
to
an
impenetrable
thicket
and
stopped
looking
at
it
confusedly
How
about
this
trail
Ernie
suggested
pointing
to
a
narrow
path
that
led
through
the
underbrush
in
the
opposite
direction
from
the
trail
they
had
come
in
on
It
was
also
luckily
leading
the
opposite
direction
from
the
jungle
drums
Captain
Memory
snapped
his
fingers
Of
course
That
s
it
A
trail
We
need
a
trail
Now
why
didn
t
I
think
of
that
Good
question
Sterno
agreed
Captain
Memory
headed
purposefully
down
the
trail
the
others
following
behind
him
Within
seconds
the
forest
seemed
to
close
in
