a
trench
coat
and
a
fedora
strode
purposefully
in
Scotland
Yard
he
announced
No
one
leave
this
room
A
crowd
of
Bobbies
seemed
to
have
materialized
outside
of
both
sets
of
doors
Clearly
no
one
was
going
to
be
able
to
leave
this
room
until
the
detective
was
ready
to
allow
it
Ernie
frowned
This
was
beginning
to
remind
him
an
awful
lot
of
some
movie
or
other
although
he
still
couldn
t
remember
which
one
it
was
Oh
I
remember
this
Captain
Memory
exclaimed
delightedly
This
is
a
game
called
MYSTERY
you
know
one
of
those
who
dunnit
things
We
have
to
solve
the
mystery
The
captain
seemed
very
pleased
This
is
great
fun
The
detective
scanned
all
of
their
faces
carefully
So
here
we
all
are
at
last
he
said
At
last
Ernie
thought
Uh
we
only
just
got
here
Ernie
said
tentatively
wiping
his
greasy
hands
on
his
fur
loincloth
And
we
really
don
t
know
anything
about
this
so
if
you
don
t
mind
we
ll
just
be
on
our
He
started
to
get
up
Sit
DOWN
shouted
the
detective
No
one
leaves
until
I
say
so
Ernie
sat
He
hadn
t
really
thought
he
was
going
to
get
away
with
that
but
he
d
though
he
d
give
it
a
try
anyway
So
the
detective
continued
We
know
you
all
had
a
reason
for
wanting
Lord
Foofaraw
dead
The
foursome
all
looked
at
one
another
Ernie
shrugged
Captain
Memory
shrugged
The
Fly
shrugged
Sterno
shrugged
in
a
very
un
doglike
manner
Well
actually
Ernie
began
tentatively
No
I
A
likely
story
interrupted
the
detective
Here
you
are
wearing
a
fur
loincloth
and
a
plastic
broadsword
carrying
He
cocked
an
eye
quizzically
at
Ernie
a
coffee
maker
And
you
expect
me
to
believe
a
story
like
that
And
just
WHERE
did
you
get
that
bag
of
gold
anyway
Ernie
began
to
feel
very
self
conscious
He
decided
that
perhaps
he
had
better
keep
his
mouth
shut
It
didn
t
seem
to
him
that
saying
Attila
the
Hun
gave
it
to
me
would
go
over
very
well
And
what
about
those
LAMB
CHOPS
the
detective
thundered
Everyone
knows
that
one
never
serves
lamb
chops
for
tea
So
just
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
Ernie
shrank
down
into
his
seat
And
YOU
The
detective
jabbed
a
finger
at
the
Fly
who
flinched
You
blamed
Lord
Foofaraw
for
your
terrible
accident
didn
t
you
The
accident
that
left
you
horribly
disfigured
and
left
Lord
Foofaraw
free
to
start
an
affair
with
YOUR
WIFE
But
but
I
don
t
even
have
a
wife
The
Fly
began
his
antennae
waving
in
consternation
All
these
years
you
ve
plotted
revenge
haven
t
you
the
detective
continued
And
now
suddenly
mysteriously
Lord
Foofaraw
turns
up
DEAD
What
are
we
to
make
of
THAT
my
fine
Fly
friend
But
but
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
wildly
The
detective
however
had
already
gone
on
to
the
next
suspect
And
YOU
He
jabbed
a
finger
at
Sterno
You
ve
had
no
reward
for
years
of
faithful
service
have
you
You
ve
worked
like
a
dog
running
and
fetching
every
time
his
Lordship
snapped
his
fingers
We
know
how
you
resented
it
how
you
longed
to
even
the
score
Yet
year
after
year
you
let
his
Lordship
treat
you
like
an
animal
with
never
a
whimper
of
complaint
And
NOW
here
you
are
helping
yourself
to
his
Lordship
s
best
brandy
and
cigars
What
would
his
Lordship
have
thought
of
THAT
Sterno
thought
fast
Woof
he
answered
The
detective
however
had
already
gone
on
to
the
next
suspect
And
finally
the
detective
said
leaving
a
pregnant
pause
we
have
YOU
He
jabbed
a
finger
in
Captain
Memory
s
face
The
famous
Captain
Memory
Through
Space
and
Time
Without
a
Dime
I
think
you
ve
been
heard
to
say
Actually
I
sort
of
prefer
Through
Time
and
Space
to
a
Better
Place
answered
the
Captain
conversationally
A
likely
story
snapped
the
detective
We
know
what
you
ve
been
up
to
We
see
you
when
you
re
sleeping
We
know
if
you
re
awake
We
know
if
you
ve
been
bad
or
good
so
be
He
stopped
abruptly
glancing
suspiciously
about
him
Never
mind
The
question
here
is
just
exactly
how
do
you
JUMP
out
of
sectors
that
aren
t
supposed
to
accept
any
external
commands
anyway
Captain
Memory
frowned
What
does
that
have
to
do
with
Lord
Foofaraw
You
know
very
well
what
it
has
to
do
with
the
case
snapped
the
detective
Just
answer
the
question
Suddenly
a
light
went
on
in
Ernie
s
head
He
suddenly
remembered
how
all
the
pieces
fit
together
I
know
he
shouted
The
BUTLER
DID
IT
The
butler
blanched
Hey
mon
he
cried
out
What
chu
talkin
about
I
don
do
nothin
The
detective
looked
irritated
Don
t
change
the
subject
he
snapped
He
turned
back
to
Captain
Memory
Awright
youse
guys
Talk
Youse
guys
ain
t
gonna
play
me
for
a
patsy
Ernie
and
the
Fly
looked
at
each
other
in
confusion
The
detective
continued
You
lousy
two
bit
gunsels
think
you
can
take
a
rod
and
One
of
the
Bobbies
came
in
hurriedly
tapped
the
detective
on
the
shoulder
and
whispered
something
in
his
