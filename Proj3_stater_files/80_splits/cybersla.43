t
seem
to
be
a
very
satisfactory
answer
to
him
Let
s
go
inside
shall
we
suggested
Sterno
The
smoke
from
that
burning
village
is
bothering
my
sinuses
Good
idea
said
Mr
Ed
and
led
the
way
They
crossed
the
Roman
style
marble
porch
walked
through
an
open
atrium
with
a
gurgling
fountain
in
the
middle
of
it
and
came
to
a
huge
oak
door
covered
with
iron
studs
Inside
was
a
s
style
suburban
living
room
complete
with
blond
furniture
and
a
free
form
coffee
table
Ernie
frowned
You
know
somehow
this
looks
out
of
place
to
me
Captain
Memory
sighed
Now
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
WORLD
database
is
all
screwed
up
too
Somebody
s
teacher
s
gonna
be
really
mad
about
this
Ernie
continued
to
frown
You
notice
that
we
come
across
an
awful
lot
of
fifties
type
stuff
How
come
we
don
t
get
forties
stuff
or
seventies
stuff
How
come
it
s
always
fifties
stuff
Captain
Memory
sighed
and
dropped
heavily
into
the
green
fifties
style
sofa
Oh
I
m
sure
there
s
a
logical
explanation
for
it
I
just
can
t
think
of
it
at
the
moment
Mr
Ed
pawed
the
ground
nervously
Say
you
re
not
suspicious
or
anything
are
you
There
s
nothing
to
be
suspicious
of
Everything
s
perfectly
safe
Somehow
this
reassurance
failed
to
make
Ernie
feel
any
better
Mr
Ed
pointed
his
muzzle
towards
a
large
floor
model
fifties
style
television
set
Say
you
wanna
watch
some
TV
NO
Ernie
was
not
ready
to
cope
with
any
more
TV
Mr
Ed
seemed
taken
aback
You
don
t
have
to
shout
he
said
in
a
hurt
tone
clopping
off
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
Aww
now
you
hurt
his
feelings
said
the
Fly
accusingly
He
set
off
to
try
to
console
Mr
Ed
Captain
Memory
was
pulling
some
objects
out
of
hidden
pockets
in
his
costume
Ah
here
it
is
he
said
producing
his
favorite
item
the
TV
Guide
Ernie
felt
his
stomach
grumbling
He
was
getting
really
hungry
by
now
He
hadn
t
gotten
anything
to
eat
back
at
the
gingerbread
cottage
when
the
others
were
stuffing
their
faces
He
was
beginning
to
really
regret
that
now
He
noticed
an
open
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
living
room
and
decided
to
go
and
investigate
it
Through
the
door
was
a
typical
suburban
kitchen
His
eyes
immediately
fixed
on
one
object
the
refrigerator
He
threw
it
open
excitedly
Unfortunately
it
was
empty
except
for
a
box
of
baking
soda
Maybe
there
would
be
something
in
the
freezer
Ernie
opened
the
freezer
door
and
started
back
in
horror
There
frozen
into
immobility
was
the
most
hideous
disgusting
totally
alien
monstrosity
that
Ernie
had
ever
seen
One
of
it
s
tentacles
or
pseudopods
or
whatever
they
were
was
frozen
into
the
ice
cube
tray
Another
seemed
to
be
reaching
for
a
box
of
popsicles
Ernie
s
stomach
turned
over
and
he
slammed
the
freezer
door
in
disgust
Ernie
ran
back
into
the
living
room
There
s
the
most
awful
thing
in
the
freezer
he
exclaimed
excitedly
Oh
yeah
Captain
Memory
wasn
t
actually
paying
attention
Yeah
Ernie
went
on
agitatedly
It
s
some
kind
of
weird
alien
thing
and
it
s
frozen
into
the
ice
cube
tray
Oh
yes
Sterno
commented
calmly
Aliens
in
the
ice
cube
trays
We
get
them
all
the
time
Rather
a
nuisance
Unsanitary
don
t
you
know
What
Must
you
always
shout
Sterno
said
reprovingly
I
have
very
delicate
hearing
you
know
Oh
um
sorry
Ernie
was
embarrassed
Apparently
no
one
seemed
to
consider
the
alien
very
important
Sterno
thought
a
moment
Were
there
by
any
chance
some
popsicles
in
that
refrigerator
Ernie
was
surprised
Uh
yeah
there
were
How
did
you
know
that
Oh
yes
Sterno
continued
They
re
always
found
with
popsicles
you
know
That
s
why
they
come
to
Earth
we
believe
To
steal
popsicles
But
then
they
accidentally
step
into
the
ice
cube
tray
in
the
Quick
Chill
section
and
get
frozen
stiff
Wasn
t
that
a
movie
the
Fly
chimed
in
momentarily
breaking
off
his
conversation
with
Mr
Ed
The
word
movie
caught
Captain
Memory
s
attention
Oh
yeah
Sure
the
Fly
went
on
enthusiastically
I
remember
that
now
THE
THING
It
was
a
s
science
fiction
movie
about
this
alien
frozen
into
the
ice
at
the
North
Pole
Great
movie
Captain
Memory
agreed
With
James
Arness
as
the
Thing
I
thought
James
Arness
was
Marshall
Matt
Dillon
on
Gunsmoke
said
the
Fly
puzzled
Mmm
hmm
Captain
Memory
agreed
But
he
was
also
the
alien
Imagine
that
the
Fly
shook
his
head
wonderingly
Marshall
Matt
Dillon
was
an
alien
No
wonder
he
was
so
quick
on
the
draw
Ernie
fidgeted
anxiously
So
what
should
I
do
about
it
About
what
Sterno
asked
only
half
paying
attention
The
ALIEN
Ernie
cried
Please
winced
Sterno
putting
his
paws
over
his
ears
Oh
Sorry
Ernie
lowered
his
voice
That
s
better
Sterno
lowered
his
paws
Just
don
t
thaw
it
out
Leave
it
DON
T
thaw
it
out
Sterno
repeated
emphatically
Ernie
considered
this
Why
would
aliens
steal
popsicles
he
wondered
Because
they
haven
t
any
money
I
suppose
Sterno
mused
They
can
t
buy
them
if
they
haven
