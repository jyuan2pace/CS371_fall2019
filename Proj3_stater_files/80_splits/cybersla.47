strawberry
The
Captain
laughed
I
couldn
t
very
well
have
a
strawberry
remote
could
I
Ernie
moaned
quietly
Uh
I
think
I
know
what
happened
to
it
Sterno
looked
at
Ernie
aghast
You
DIDN
T
Ernie
nodded
sadly
Sterno
turned
to
Captain
Memory
He
ATE
it
Captain
Memory
looked
at
Ernie
incredulously
How
could
you
EAT
a
remote
control
unit
Well
Ernie
was
embarrassed
Actually
it
was
pretty
good
Suddenly
a
disturbing
thought
occurred
to
him
Say
it
s
not
poison
or
anything
is
it
Captain
Memory
looked
thoughtful
I
don
t
know
nobody
s
ever
eaten
one
before
He
thought
a
moment
I
guess
we
ll
find
out
won
t
we
Ernie
moaned
quietly
Well
well
If
they
re
gonna
make
a
remote
control
unit
that
looks
like
a
candy
bar
they
ought
to
put
a
warning
on
it
or
something
They
did
Captain
Memory
answered
I
didn
t
see
any
warning
cried
Ernie
indignantly
All
I
saw
was
a
piece
of
blank
white
paper
That
s
the
warning
the
Captain
explained
It
means
Don
t
Eat
this
Remote
Control
Unit
in
Franglian
Franglian
You
know
like
they
speak
on
the
planet
Franglia
Captain
Memory
acted
as
though
this
were
perfectly
obvious
to
everyone
But
nobody
on
Earth
speaks
Franglian
Ernie
protested
Captain
Memory
considered
this
Well
then
I
guess
it
s
not
much
good
is
it
He
pulled
out
his
TV
Guide
Hey
you
wanna
watch
some
TV
Ernie
s
stomach
was
beginning
to
feel
very
bad
indeed
Actually
watching
TV
was
about
the
last
thing
he
wanted
to
do
but
considering
the
looks
everyone
was
giving
him
at
the
moment
he
thought
perhaps
he
had
just
better
keep
his
mouth
shut
The
Fly
and
Mr
Ed
returned
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
Mr
Ed
seemed
to
have
cheered
up
considerably
Hey
what
s
on
TV
the
Fly
asked
Captain
Memory
Let
me
see
the
Captain
leafed
through
the
pages
Wanna
watch
a
movie
How
about
Beach
Blanket
Chainsaw
Massacre
Irate
viewers
get
sick
of
aging
beach
stars
and
cut
them
up
with
power
tools
with
Frankie
Avalon
Annette
Funicello
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
Maybe
said
the
Fly
thoughtfully
What
else
is
on
You
like
horror
movies
said
the
Captain
How
about
Goldfish
from
Hell
Suburban
family
discovers
their
pet
is
possessed
by
evil
spirits
with
Flipper
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
Nah
said
the
Fly
I
don
t
like
horror
movies
How
about
Gidget
Goes
Berserk
Gidget
gets
a
chainsaw
for
Christmas
and
Oh
no
Sterno
broke
in
I
simply
cannot
tolerate
Gidget
movies
How
about
Kung
Fu
Tigers
Go
Hawaiian
with
Bruce
Lee
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
Ernie
noticed
something
odd
about
the
TV
listings
Say
doesn
t
it
seem
a
little
strange
that
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
are
in
all
these
different
movies
No
I
don
t
think
it
s
strange
at
all
drawled
Mr
Ed
Do
you
Sterno
glared
at
Ernie
After
all
YOU
VE
done
I
should
think
you
d
be
content
to
sit
quietly
and
mind
your
own
business
Hey
you
ll
like
this
Captain
Memory
said
to
the
Fly
Wanna
watch
the
Miss
Galaxy
Pageant
Sure
thing
the
Fly
enthused
Turn
it
on
Okay
I
ll
get
up
and
turn
it
on
I
ll
have
to
get
up
because
The
Captain
glared
at
Ernie
I
don
t
have
a
remote
Ernie
shrank
into
his
seat
The
Captain
turned
on
the
television
and
here
s
our
celebrity
judges
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
The
camera
panned
in
to
the
two
celebrities
That
s
odd
thought
Ernie
They
don
t
look
the
way
I
remember
them
I
don
t
recall
them
having
such
pointy
teeth
Oh
well
it
s
probably
just
the
lighting
or
something
Now
our
first
contestant
The
girls
began
parading
by
Ernie
noticed
that
the
girls
in
this
pageant
didn
t
look
quite
like
the
one
s
he
was
used
to
seeing
For
one
thing
they
were
all
a
lot
plumper
than
the
beauty
queens
at
home
None
of
them
seemed
to
have
much
personality
either
They
all
looked
sort
of
bovine
Isn
t
she
a
delicious
young
lady
the
announcer
was
saying
Look
at
those
scrumptious
legs
those
mouth
watering
shoulders
those
tender
juicy
thighs
Gee
these
girls
aren
t
very
cute
said
the
Fly
disappointed
Not
like
at
home
They
look
positively
delicious
to
me
commented
Mr
Ed
Ernie
looked
at
Mr
Ed
suspiciously
That
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
very
strange
comment
to
be
coming
from
a
horse
But
then
come
to
think
of
it
any
comment
was
strange
coming
from
a
horse
You
wanna
watch
something
else
Captain
Memory
asked
the
Fly
No
no
that
s
okay
said
the
Fly
quickly
I
m
sure
they
ll
get
better
The
pageant
continued
our
next
mouth
watering
contestant
The
camera
cut
to
the
celebrity
judges
They
seemed
to
be
drooling
slightly
A
little
forked
tongue
seemed
to
dart
in
and
out
of
their
mouths
Or
maybe
it
was
just
a
trick
of
the
light
Ernie
felt
uneasy
Beauty
pageants
at
home
weren
t
like
this
He
decided
to
try
not
to
look
at
it
He
regarded
the
horse
instead
There
was
definitely
something
peculiar
about
that
horse
Ernie
decided
