Ernie
looked
up
Do
you
get
the
feeling
they
re
playing
games
with
us
he
asked
the
others
Oh
NO
cried
the
Fly
desperately
What
said
Ernie
alarmed
I
wrote
in
the
space
that
says
Do

wailed
the
Fly
Tsk
tsk
said
Sterno
You
re
in
big
trouble
now
Ernie
was
glad
that
it
was
someone
other
than
himself
who
was
in
big
trouble
for
a
change
He
looked
over
at
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
was
having
a
hard
time
filling
out
his
forms
He
seemed
to
have
gotten
stuck
Ernie
looked
over
his
shoulder
As
a
matter
of
fact
the
Captain
seemed
to
have
gotten
stuck
on
the
first
space
NAME
Should
I
put
Captain
Memory
or
Memory
Captain
he
mused
Ernie
noticed
that
the
Captain
s
form
was
different
from
his
Ernie
read

five

I
know
said
Captain
Memory
I
can
put
Memory
under
Name
and
Captain
under
Rank
I
wonder
what
I
should
put
under
Cereal
Number
Ernie
suddenly
became
very
uneasy
I
think
maybe
we
should
just
get
out
of
here
while
we
have
the
chance
Sterno
was
leafing
through
his
pile
of
papers
Aha
he
cried
Here
we
go
Form
Request
for
Authorization
to
Apply
for
a
License
to
Purchase
Cigars
Now
we
re
getting
somewhere
Sterno
did
not
find
the
forms
upsetting
at
all
In
fact
he
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
able
to
deal
with
them
He
began
scribbling
industriously
in
the
blanks
As
Ernie
watched
he
took
his
sheaf
of
forms
to
one
of
the
windows
where
it
was
stamped
He
then
took
it
to
another
window
where
a
large
gold
seal
was
affixed
to
it
Then
on
to
another
window
where
several
people
signed
it
He
then
disappeared
around
a
corner
and
returned
moments
later
carrying
a
large
box
of
cigars
Wow
The
Fly
was
awestruck
That
s
amazing
I
wonder
how
he
does
that
It
s
not
really
that
difficult
commented
Sterno
lighting
up
a
big
cigar
His
disposition
always
improved
tremendously
when
he
had
a
cigar
I
ll
tell
you
a
secret
the
universe
is
actually
a
giant
bureaucracy
It
s
possible
to
get
anything
in
the
Cosmos
done
if
you
fill
out
the
right
forms
However
filling
out
the
right
forms
can
sometimes
be
very
difficult
indeed
He
puffed
his
cigar
appreciatively
Havanas
no
less
One
needs
a
special
permit
to
get
these
I
ll
have
you
know
The
Fly
meanwhile
was
intent
on
trying
to
erase
what
he
had
written
in
the
space
marked
Do
Not
Write
in
This
Space
So
far
he
had
only
succeeded
in
tearing
a
hole
in
the
paper
Ernie
meanwhile
was
noticing
the
fact
that
all
the
clerks
and
tellers
seemed
to
be
watching
them
Another
unusual
thing
struck
him
Hey
guys
he
commented
Did
you
notice
that
there
s
all
these
clerks
and
all
these
officials
but
no
customers
besides
us
Egad
that
IS
odd
agreed
Sterno
Everyone
knows
that
the
usual
ratio
is
customers
per
clerk
He
looked
around
Where
ARE
all
the
lines
I
ve
never
seen
a
government
office
this
empty
except
of
course
at
the
Administration
for
Not
Doing
Anything
At
All
Building
and
even
there
only
after
P
M
on
weekends
It
does
seem
suspicious
Ernie
was
thrilled
