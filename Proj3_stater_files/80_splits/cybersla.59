grounds
A
road
led
through
the
fence
and
up
to
the
front
door
Lacking
any
better
ideas
the
foursome
walked
down
the
road
and
up
to
the
front
door
The
door
was
massive
and
imposing
with
a
huge
cast
iron
door
knocker
in
the
middle
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
Captain
Memory
looked
at
the
Fly
The
Fly
looked
at
Sterno
Sterno
looked
at
Ernie
Ernie
looked
around
Everyone
was
looking
at
him
Ernie
sighed
and
stepped
up
to
the
door
Tentatively
he
raised
the
knocker
and
let
it
drop
It
made
a
surprisingly
loud
sound
Ernie
flinched
He
waited
Nothing
happened
Try
it
again
Sterno
demanded
Ernie
frowned
Why
don
t
you
try
it
He
had
a
bad
feeling
about
this
place
It
looked
like
someplace
he
had
seen
in
a
movie
sometime
He
didn
t
remember
what
movie
it
was
or
what
happened
but
it
was
something
bad
Well
obviously
I
m
not
tall
enough
to
reach
it
said
Sterno
patronizingly
Anyway
it
s
your
job
Why
is
it
my
job
cried
Ernie
indignantly
Why
is
it
always
my
job
You
started
it
retorted
Sterno
Ernie
sighed
He
knew
there
would
be
some
reason
why
it
was
his
job
He
always
got
stuck
with
things
like
this
Who
knows
what
kind
of
horrible
creature
would
answer
the
door
Even
if
it
was
a
normal
person
what
was
he
supposed
to
say
to
them
anyway
Oh
well
might
as
well
get
it
over
with
He
raised
the
knocker
and
slammed
it
down
several
times
raising
a
tremendous
din
that
no
one
in
the
house
could
have
missed
They
waited
Nothing
happened
Well
nobody
s
home
said
Ernie
lightly
I
guess
we
might
as
well
go
Oh
come
ON
snapped
Sterno
irritatedly
Where
are
we
supposed
to
go
anyway
Try
the
doorknob
Ernie
shifted
the
coffee
maker
to
his
other
hand
and
gingerly
touched
the
huge
cast
iron
doorknob
half
expecting
an
explosion
or
an
electric
shock
Nothing
happened
He
tried
to
turn
it
It
was
very
securely
locked
and
totally
unmovable
Well
door
s
locked
said
Ernie
in
a
cheerful
tone
Might
as
well
go
We
ll
find
another
way
in
said
Sterno
sternly
Let
s
walk
around
the
building
Ernie
grimaced
The
others
however
seemed
content
to
follow
Sterno
as
he
headed
off
around
the
corner
to
the
left
Ernie
supposed
there
was
no
way
to
get
out
of
this
so
he
followed
as
well
bringing
up
the
rear
A
small
garden
path
led
around
the
corner
of
the
building
through
the
English
garden
and
to
a
nicely
tended
stone
patio
French
doors
led
from
the
house
to
the
patio
Just
as
I
thought
Sterno
declared
He
strode
purposefully
up
to
the
doors
and
tried
the
knob
They
were
unlocked
He
led
the
way
into
the
house
They
found
themselves
in
a
luxurious
English
style
study
the
walls
panelled
with
dark
oak
and
lined
with
shelves
containing
leather
bound
books
Sterno
headed
immediately
for
a
small
occasional
table
by
the
wall
Aha
he
cried
I
knew
it
He
flipped
open
a
dark
wood
box
revealing
a
store
of
excellent
cigars
He
grabbed
a
handful
of
them
lighting
one
immediately
Ahhh
He
exhaled
a
cloud
of
blue
smoke
His
eyes
lit
upon
a
decanter
sitting
next
to
the
humidor
Lovely
he
exclaimed
Brandy
anyone
Ernie
sighed
wearily
All
this
stress
was
just
too
much
for
him
he
decided
Luckily
there
was
a
large
overstuffed
Victorian
sofa
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
room
Ernie
dropped
heavily
onto
it
followed
by
Captain
Memory
and
the
Fly
Captain
Memory
scanned
the
room
slowly
I
wonder
where
they
keep
their
TV
he
said
pensively
The
sofa
faced
to
large
oak
doors
which
Ernie
supposed
must
lead
to
the
rest
of
the
house
Ernie
considered
them
wondering
if
they
should
try
to
explore
the
house
further
No
he
decided
let
s
just
leave
well
enough
alone
At
that
moment
the
doors
flew
open
In
the
doorway
stood
a
tall
very
British
looking
gentleman
with
a
white
handlebar
mustache
wearing
a
smoking
jacket
and
a
top
hat
How
good
of
you
to
come
he
announced
jovially
I
m
Lord
Foofaraw
Do
make
yourselves
at
home
Tea
anyone
A
butler
entered
carrying
a
silver
tray
full
of
teacups
and
three
large
covered
silver
dishes
Ernie
gratefully
accepted
a
cup
of
tea
and
peeked
under
the
covers
of
the
dishes
The
first
two
contained
unappetizing
looking
little
ornamental
sandwiches
They
seemed
to
be
made
of
plastic
or
some
other
not
entirely
edible
material
At
this
point
however
Ernie
was
so
ravenously
hungry
he
would
have
eaten
practically
anything
even
items
that
were
only
marginally
edible
However
Ernie
decided
to
check
the
third
dish
What
luck
It
contained
a
large
pile
of
fresh
hot
sizzling
lamb
chops
broiled
to
perfection
Ernie
loved
lamb
chops
He
grabbed
the
entire
dish
off
the
tray
and
began
wolfing
them
down
eating
them
with
his
bare
hands
As
Ernie
s
hunger
subsided
he
began
to
feel
self
conscious
They
seemed
to
be
having
an
elegant
English
tea
with
a
titled
British
nobleman
and
here
he
was
wearing
a
fur
loincloth
carrying
a
plastic
broadsword
and
a
coffee
maker
and
eating
lamb
chops
with
his
bare
hands
It
