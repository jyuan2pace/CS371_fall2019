be
that
way
about
it
He
got
up
and
strode
across
the
living
room
and
through
an
open
doorway
which
seemed
to
lead
into
the
kitchen
Hey
wait
for
me
cried
Ernie
chasing
after
him
As
he
ran
he
grabbed
the
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
He
wasn
t
about
to
leave
a
fortune
in
precious
Bakelite
behind
He
continued
to
follow
the
Captain
He
didn
t
know
where
Captain
Memory
was
going
but
he
figured
it
would
have
to
be
an
improvement
The
Captain
walked
through
the
next
room
which
was
the
typical
suburban
kitchen
opened
a
typical
suburban
back
door
and
stepped
outside
Ernie
and
the
others
followed
quickly
behind
him
They
found
themselves
once
again
standing
in
a
countryside
of
green
rolling
hills
The
village
in
the
distance
seemed
to
have
burned
itself
out
and
only
feeble
wisps
of
smoke
were
rising
from
it
I
m
awfully
glad
we
got
out
of
there
commented
Sterno
It
was
really
getting
dreadfully
noisy
My
ears
are
very
sensitive
you
know
The
Fly
was
the
last
of
the
group
to
leave
the
villa
He
shook
his
head
sadly
Poor
Mr
Ed
It
must
have
been
a
real
shock
to
him
falling
in
half
like
that
Ernie
considered
trying
to
explain
the
situation
to
him
but
decided
it
wasn
t
worth
the
trouble
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Now
what
Captain
Memory
looked
around
Nice
day
isn
t
it
Ernie
tapped
his
feet
impatiently
I
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
we
went
someplace
else
They
re
going
to
be
coming
after
us
any
minute
now
Not
after
US
Sterno
corrected
After
YOU
Ernie
frowned
Yeah
They
want
my
brain
They
don
t
want
your
brain
Sterno
thought
about
this
and
decided
he
was
offended
Well
That
just
shows
what
those
silly
aliens
know
If
they
knew
anything
about
brains
at
all
they
d
realize
mine
is
clearly
superior
An
idea
occurred
to
Ernie
Yeah
you
re
right
Maybe
I
should
tell
them
Sterno
frowned
You
know
I
think
we
should
go
someplace
else
It
s
suddenly
become
awfully
boring
around
here
Nice
day
for
a
walk
don
t
you
think
said
Captain
Memory
strolling
off
towards
the
yellow
brick
road
The
others
followed
quickly
CHAPTER
After
a
few
minutes
walking
the
four
travelers
through
Cyberspace
began
to
see
an
encampment
of
some
kind
in
the
distance
What
do
you
suppose
that
is
Ernie
wondered
I
dunno
commented
Captain
Memory
Want
to
turn
around
and
go
the
other
way
Ernie
thought
of
Lucy
Ricky
and
Vito
all
of
whom
were
somewhere
behind
them
No
let
s
just
keep
going
It
doesn
t
really
matter
which
way
we
go
commented
Sterno
After
all
all
roads
lead
to
Rome
Ernie
thought
about
that
It
seems
to
me
that
would
cause
a
lot
of
traffic
problems
he
said
reflectively
The
Fly
peered
into
the
distance
Somebody
s
coming
Ernie
started
Uh
oh
what
do
we
do
now
He
thought
a
moment
Are
they
Romans
or
Huns
How
should
I
know
The
Fly
answered
Well
what
are
they
wearing
Funny
outfits
The
Fly
shrugged
What
are
they
supposed
to
be
wearing
Ernie
sighed
I
dunno
I
sort
of
hoped
they
d
be
wearing
togas
or
something
The
men
approaching
were
coming
into
Ernie
s
range
of
vision
They
seemed
to
be
a
military
patrol
They
wore
armor
some
kind
of
leggings
and
carried
shields
bows
and
spears
So
what
are
they
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
Romans
or
Huns
I
dunno
Ernie
said
Might
as
well
flip
a
coin
I
guess
You
got
a
coin
I
left
all
my
money
in
my
other
pants
pocket
Ernie
admitted
So
just
pick
one
then
the
Fly
urged
Well
Romans
then
If
they
re
Romans
we
could
talk
to
them
in
Latin
I
don
t
know
what
we
could
do
if
they
re
Huns
What
language
do
they
speak
Hungarian
I
don
t
speak
Hungarian
Do
you
speak
Latin
asked
Sterno
sarcastically
Well
well
I
used
to
watch
a
lot
of
gladiator
movies
said
Ernie
hopefully
Good
enough
said
the
Fly
encouragingly
You
go
talk
to
them
then
Why
ME
It
was
your
idea
the
Fly
returned
It
was
NOT
my
idea
I
never
We
ll
just
go
hide
in
these
bushes
in
the
meantime
The
Fly
sprinted
off
towards
a
little
group
of
bushes
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
followed
by
Sterno
and
Captain
Memory
Ernie
saw
that
the
soldiers
had
noticed
him
They
were
pointing
in
his
direction
and
saying
something
that
Ernie
could
not
make
out
Ernie
decided
his
only
course
of
action
was
to
brazen
it
out
He
bit
his
lip
uncertainly
and
walked
forward
in
what
he
hoped
would
seem
like
a
confident
manner
He
tried
to
think
of
something
to
say
in
Latin
Uh
E
Pluribus
Unum
he
called
out
Gallia
est
divisio
in
partes
tres
They
soldiers
looked
at
him
Hey
get
a
load
a
this
the
first
soldier
said
It
s
a
Roman
in
a
funny
outfit
He
turned
to
the
soldier
next
to
him
Hey
Frank
gimme
an
arrow
will
ya
I
wanna
shoot
this
guy
Ernie
realized
that
he
had
made
a
serious
tactical
error
He
decided
that
the
correct
move
at
this
