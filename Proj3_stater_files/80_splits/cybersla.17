cried
the
guards
peering
into
the
distance
The
Fly
threw
his
entire
weight
against
the
door
which
flew
open
RUN
he
cried
to
the
others
He
sprinted
toward
center
stage
followed
by
Ernie
Sterno
and
Captain
Memory
A
startled
von
Liederkranz
was
on
center
stage
trying
to
flirt
with
the
chorus
girls
Guards
he
cried
Don
t
let
dem
get
avay
He
grabbed
the
nearest
weapon
which
in
this
case
happened
to
be
an
alien
Blaster
of
unknown
properties
He
aimed
it
at
the
foursome
who
were
sprinting
towards
a
door
marked
EXIT
Shtop
or
I
ll
shoot
Von
Liederkranz
threatened
The
four
continued
to
run
Von
Liederkranz
pulled
the
trigger
A
huge
ball
of
magneto
gravitational
energy
flashed
from
the
muzzle
of
the
Blaster
instantly
hurtling
Ernie
and
the
others
into
a
totally
different
Space
Time
Continuum
Von
Liederkranz
looked
ruefully
at
the
Blaster
and
then
at
the
smoking
hole
in
the
stage
where
the
foursome
had
been
only
a
nanosecond
earlier
Vell

Liederkranz
admitted
Perhaps

Chapter
Ernie
Captain
Memory
Sterno
and
the
Fly
sat
on
a
rocky
crag
overlooking
a
lifeless
purple
sea
They
watched
the
waves
crash
against
the
rocks
beneath
them
Ernie
sighed
So
where
are
we
now
Well
as
far
as
I
can
figure
out
said
Captain
Memory
thoughtfully
We
seem
to
have
been
blasted
back
to
somewhere
on
the
order
of
four
billion
B
C
Life
has
not
evolved
yet
on
Earth
Huh
said
Ernie
You
mean
we
traveled
in
time
Of
course
not
the
Captain
replied
What
really
happened
is
that
we
got
sent
to
another
sector
of
Cyberspace
Probably
by
accident
Captain
Memory
looked
around
After
all
I
can
t
see
any
reason
for
Von
Liederkranz
to
have
sent
us
here
on
purpose
Ernie
looked
out
over
the
purple
waves
So
where
ARE
we
I
mean
really
Captain
Memory
thought
a
moment
We
re
probably
in
somebody
s
Geology
program
You
know
like
computer
models
of
primeval
Earth
He
looked
at
the
barren
landscape
While
we
didn
t
actually
travel
in
time
it
s
almost
as
if
we
did
This
is
like
actually
being
on
Earth
at
the
beginning
of
life
Wow
thought
Ernie
That
s
really
cosmic
The
Fly
looked
at
the
bare
rocks
around
them
You
know
man
this
place
is
like
really
dead
Exactly
Captain
Memory
agreed
I
mean
the
Fly
went
on
There
is
like
no
girls
None
at
all
That
s
right
So
like
what
good
is
it
Captain
Memory
thought
a
moment
Good
question
Ernie
watched
the
orange
sun
in
a
green
sky
which
was
slowly
setting
against
a
purple
sea
This
is
really
a
weird
scene
he
commented
I
have
never
seen
anything
like
this
Not
even
on
TV
He
thought
about
that
for
a
moment
Not
even
on
TV
Why
that
could
mean
that
there
s
No
TV
Captain
Memory
agreed
Not
much
reason
to
stay
here
then
is
there
Ernie
noticed
a
motion
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
I
m
not
sure
you
ought
to
throw
those
cigar
butts
on
the
ground
here
he
said
to
Sterno
Sterno
looked
annoyed
Why
in
the
world
not
Well
I
don
t
know
that
much
about
this
Ernie
said
But
it
seems
to
me
I
read
somewhere
that
the
further
you
go
back
in
time
the
more
effect
your
actions
have
on
the
future
Therefore
if
we
make
even
little
changes
way
back
here
in
four
billion
B
C
it
might
have
some
kind
of
real
big
effect
by
the
time
we
get
back
to
our
own
time
Utterly
ridiculous
scoffed
Sterno
flicking
cigar
ash
into
the
sea
This
isn
t
REALLY
four
billion
B
C
it
s
only
a
computer
model
of
four
billion
B
C
Well
yeah
Ernie
admitted
uneasily
But
the
Captain
said
that
this
was
almost
the
same
as
really
being
there
And
I
dunno
I
just
have
a
real
bad
feeling
about
those
cigar
butts
Really
Sterno
looked
totally
bored
I
just
can
t
tell
you
how
concerned
that
makes
me
He
yawned
Well
well
I
just
don
t
think
it
s
a
good
idea
that
s
all
Well
you
know
how
it
goes
said
Captain
Memory
jovially
It
s
all
just
six
of
one
twelve
dozen
of
another
Ernie
frowned
I
don
t
think
that
s
right
Isn
t
it
Oh
well
said
Captain
Memory
cheerily
Math
was
never
one
of
my
strong
points
Anyway
no
time
to
worry
about
that
now
Let
s
be
off
shall
we
He
though
a
moment
Let
s
try
some
Machine
Language
F
E
The
scene
vanished
The
foursome
found
themselves
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
road
in
bright
sunlight
Once
again
Ernie
blinked
and
staggered
his
stomach
doing
flip
flops
As
his
vision
cleared
He
could
see
around
him
what
appeared
to
be
an
idyllic
country
scene
A
rustic
rail
fence
bordered
the
road
Beyond
the
fence
stood
farms
surrounded
by
fields
full
of
amber
waves
of
grain
In
the
distance
stood
majestic
purple
mountains
Ernie
turned
around
Behind
them
lay
a
broad
plain
Ernie
was
pretty
sure
there
was
fruit
on
it
I
wonder
where
we
are
the
Fly
asked
Sterno
looked
around
Kansas
he
suggested
Ernie
