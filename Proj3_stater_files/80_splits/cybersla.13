studying
his
TV
Guide
Wanna
watch
some
TV
he
asked
brightly
NO
Ernie
was
building
up
a
real
aversion
to
television
Why
not
Captain
Memory
couldn
t
imagine
why
anyone
would
not
want
to
watch
TV
Look
said
Ernie
desperately
This
is
the
Stone
Age
right
There
aren
t
supposed
to
be
any
TVs
here
They
haven
t
been
invented
yet
This
is
before
television
Captain
Memory
chuckled
Don
t
be
silly
No
time
is
before
television
He
got
up
and
walked
over
to
the
set
How
primitive
Sterno
commented
No
remote
control
That
s
only
to
be
expected
in
the
Stone
Age
I
suppose
Look
said
Ernie
urgently
I
m
positive
there
were
no
televisions
in
the
Stone
Age
Captain
Memory
sighed
Be
reasonable
he
said
have
you
ever
seen
oh
let
s
say
I
Was
a
Teenage
Caveman
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Um
yes
Where
did
you
see
it
On
TV
It
takes
place
in
the
Stone
Age
right
Um
yeah
Ernie
wasn
t
sure
he
liked
the
way
this
line
of
questioning
was
going
Well
how
could
that
be
UNLESS
THERE
WERE
TELEVISIONS
IN
THE
STONE
AGE
Captain
Memory
cried
triumphantly
I
rest
my
case
Sterno
applauded
Bravo
he
said
politely
Well
well
Ernie
was
sure
there
was
something
wrong
with
this
argument
but
he
couldn
t
quite
figure
out
what
it
was
He
noticed
that
no
one
was
listening
to
him
anyway
Captain
Memory
switched
on
the
television
Being
a
primitive
set
it
took
a
long
time
to
warm
up
A
picture
of
a
room
very
much
like
the
one
the
three
were
in
appeared
on
the
television
screen
taken
from
an
odd
angle
Eww
black
and
white
sniffed
Sterno
This
really
is
the
Stone
Age
isn
t
it
Ernie
stared
at
the
picture
A
man
in
a
comic
book
character
outfit
accompanied
by
a
dog
entered
the
room
and
they
both
sat
down
After
a
short
wait
another
figure
clad
in
a
fur
loincloth
and
carrying
a
large
plastic
broadsword
also
entered
The
characters
seemed
to
be
conversing
but
their
voices
were
too
indistinct
to
understand
I
can
t
hear
what
they
re
saying
Captain
Memory
said
Seems
to
be
a
sound
problem
Sterno
sniffed
Only
to
be
expected
from
prehistoric
TV
stations
Suddenly
one
of
the
characters
pointed
directly
at
them
hidden
camera
They
heard
the
figure
say
We
re
being
watched
The
other
characters
said
something
indistinct
The
figure
in
the
loincloth
loomed
larger
and
larger
in
the
picture
until
finally
the
screen
was
entirely
taken
up
by
a
face
not
unlike
Ernie
s
own
A
huge
hand
loomed
up
over
the
screen
and
the
picture
went
dead
Ernie
looked
at
the
dead
television
screen
I
don
t
like
the
looks
of
this
at
all
he
said
warily
Neither
do
I
agreed
Captain
Memory
Let
s
watch
something
else
He
changed
the
channel
A
different
scene
appeared
In
it
two
men
were
seated
at
a
large
array
of
electronic
equipment
their
backs
to
the
audience
They
were
peering
intently
at
their
devices
and
conversing
Looks
like
they
found
the
hidden
camera
one
said
to
the
other
What
are
we
gonna
do
Let
s
switch
over
to
the
second
camera
What
if
they
find
that
one
They
won
t
They
don
t
suspect
a
thing
The
two
men
flipped
some
switches
Here
we
go
said
the
first
Wanna
see
it
Sure
The
man
flipped
a
switch
Suddenly
the
scene
changed
back
to
the
room
suspiciously
like
their
own
The
figure
in
the
loincloth
appeared
upset
Hey
cried
Ernie
Hey
cried
the
loincloth
clad
figure
on
the
television
That
s
us
That
s
us
echoed
his
TV
image
Captain
Memory
regarded
the
television
picture
Not
a
very
interesting
show
he
commented
echoed
a
moment
later
by
the
comic
book
clad
character
on
the
television
Seems
a
bit
repetitious
Might
as
well
turn
it
off
Wait
Ernie
cried
but
it
was
too
late
Captain
Memory
had
already
shut
off
the
set
Captain
Memory
was
confused
Wait
I
thought
you
didn
t
want
to
watch
TV
I
just
turned
it
off
to
be
nice
I
can
turn
it
back
on
if
you
want
He
reached
toward
the
set
NO
No
uh
that
s
okay
Uh
thanks
I
d
just
as
soon
we
didn
t
watch
anything
right
now
if
you
don
t
mind
Ernie
was
not
prepared
for
the
possible
consequences
of
turning
on
the
TV
again
He
had
more
than
enough
to
deal
with
as
it
was
Ernie
gathered
up
his
thoughts
Okay
guys
look
I
gotta
tell
you
something
This
place
is
not
what
it
seems
Really
Captain
Memory
had
returned
to
the
study
of
his
favorite
reading
matter
the
TV
Guide
Ernie
continued
This
isn
t
a
typical
Stone
Age
house
okay
It
s
actually
a
set
from
a
s
cartoon
series
called
The
Flintstones
Oh
we
know
THAT
Captain
Memory
commented
not
bothering
to
look
up
You
DO
Ernie
was
upset
Well
well
why
didn
t
you
SAY
something
You
didn
t
ask
Sterno
was
considering
something
Ernie
had
said
a
few
moments
earlier
What
makes
you
think
The
Flintstones
isn
t
typical
of
the
Stone
Age
Ernie
dropped
into
a
chair
This
was
getting
to
be
to
much
for
