she
says
I
can
t
go
today
I
gotta
wash
my
hair
That
s
true
Ernie
admitted
He
thought
a
moment
Wait
a
minute
We
have
this
stuff
at
home
In
fact
my
girlfriend
uses
it
The
Captain
considered
this
Noticed
any
changes
in
her
recently
Well
she
has
been
kind
of
cold
Ernie
conceded
And
now
that
you
mention
it
I
have
noticed
her
skin
getting
kind
of
scaly
but
I
thought
it
was
just
the
heartbreak
of
psoriasis
I
tried
to
say
something
about
it
but
she
hissed
at
me
Mmm
hmm
Captain
Memory
agreed
Y
know
I
noticed
that
a
lot
too
the
Fly
added
I
m
real
observant
and
I
noticed
that
an
awful
lot
of
pretty
girls
nowadays
have
forked
tongues
Ernie
frowned
He
had
noticed
something
odd
about
his
girlfriend
s
tongue
but
he
hadn
t
wanted
to
mention
it
He
didn
t
want
to
get
hissed
at
again
They
also
have
real
sharp
teeth
the
Fly
continued
And
slit
pupils
in
their
eyes
I
don
t
think
that
s
normal
do
you
All
of
this
was
making
Ernie
very
unhappy
You
mean
aliens
are
trying
to
take
over
the
Earth
he
asked
I
wouldn
t
doubt
it
Captain
Memory
answered
cheerfully
Well
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
cried
Ernie
Oh
you
don
t
need
to
worry
about
it
said
the
Captain
reassuringly
Why
not
asked
Ernie
suspiciously
It
s
just
a
game
anyway
right
The
Captain
gave
Ernie
a
cheery
smile
and
helped
himself
to
a
piece
of
lemon
meringue
pie
There
is
one
thing
you
could
do
Sterno
added
What
asked
Ernie
desperately
You
could
put
some
clothes
on
Sterno
said
looking
ruefully
at
the
peach
frappe
on
his
plate
The
sight
of
all
that
naked
skin
is
rather
spoiling
my
appetite
Oh
all
right
Ernie
snapped
stomping
off
to
the
bathroom
Sterno
sighed
Some
people
are
so
sensitive
he
commented
reaching
for
a
large
Cherries
Jubilee
Ernie
was
somewhat
placated
to
find
that
the
luster
had
returned
to
his
toreador
suit
The
only
thing
worse
than
having
to
go
around
in
a
toreador
outfit
was
having
to
go
around
in
a
DIRTY
toreador
outfit
He
returned
to
the
main
room
The
Fly
was
eating
what
seemed
to
be
large
cookies
of
some
kind
Hey
these
are
good
gingerbread
men
he
remarked
offering
one
to
Ernie
Ernie
examined
the
cookie
It
s
not
a
man
he
said
thoughtfully
It
looks
like
a
gingerbread
reptile
The
Fly
looked
at
the
cookies
Yeah
you
re
right
He
vacuumed
another
one
up
through
his
snout
They
re
good
though
Ernie
looked
at
the
cookie
ruefully
I
don
t
know
if
I
want
to
eat
a
reptile
Might
as
well
Captain
Memory
volunteered
It
wouldn
t
hesitate
to
eat
you
Ernie
put
the
cookie
down
quickly
He
seemed
to
have
lost
his
appetite
again
Ernie
heard
footsteps
approaching
the
house
A
man
in
a
post
office
uniform
carrying
a
bag
of
mail
was
coming
up
the
walk
Howdy
the
mailman
said
cheerfully
Nice
day
isn
t
it
Uh
yeah
Ernie
thought
he
should
be
the
one
to
answer
since
everyone
else
had
their
mouths
full
The
mailman
chatted
on
cheerily
Had
a
few
Nazis
a
mite
earlier
but
it
looks
like
it
cleared
up
He
looked
through
his
mail
Is
there
a
Mr
Ernest
Ross
here
Uh
that
s
me
Ernie
answered
unenthusiastically
Here
you
go
The
mailman
handed
Ernie
a
letter
Have
a
nice
day
He
left
Ernie
opened
the
letter
and
read
Dear

Ross

Ernie
looked
between
the
pages
There
was
no
enclosed
envelope
He
read
on
Sincerely
First
National
Bank
of
the
West
P
S
If
you
are
experiencing
financial
difficulties
at
the
moment
please

plan
As
little
as
a
trillion
dollars
a
month
could
satisfactorily
take
care
of
this
account
Thank
you
Ernie
sighed
Isn
t
there
anywhere
you
can
go
to
get
away
from
junk
mail
I
doubt
it
answered
Captain
Memory
cutting
himself
a
big
slice
of
pineapple
upside
down
cake
Ernie
sighed
and
sat
down
on
the
nearest
piece
of
furniture
which
happened
to
be
a
child
s
rocking
chair
which
was
a
bit
too
small
for
him
Ernie
noticed
while
squeezing
himself
into
it
that
the
arms
were
scraping
some
of
the
sequins
off
his
suit
Looking
down
he
