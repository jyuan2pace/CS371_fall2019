Wanna
watch
some
TV
he
asked
brightly
It
s
almost
time
for
that
great
game
show
about
the
dinosaur
age
Which
one
is
that
Ernie
couldn
t
recall
any
shows
about
dinosaurs
Oh
I
m
sure
you
ve
seen
it
It
s
real
famous
the
Captain
explained
It
s
called
YOU
BET
JURASSIC
Ernie
frowned
Something
about
that
name
did
seem
a
bit
familiar
All
these
familiar
sounding
things
that
he
couldn
t
quite
place
were
making
him
very
uneasy
Suddenly
the
television
came
on
Prepare
to
die
inferior
creatures
the
speaker
blared
Ernie
was
annoyed
I
thought
we
turned
that
off
Captain
Memory
looked
upset
Oh
dear
I
forgot
about
that
Ernie
began
to
get
that
queasy
feeling
in
his
stomach
again
Forgot
about
WHAT
The
television
screen
showed
a
huge
purple
vegetable
lifting
itself
up
on
a
green
stalk
It
seemed
to
be
gloating
insofar
as
a
vegetable
can
gloat
You
will
soon
respire
your
last
animal
scum
the
vegetable
continued
No
longer
shall
we
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
be
your
helpless
victims
to
be
bred
and
destroyed
at
your
whims
The
day
of
reckoning
is
here
at
last
Prepare
to
receive
the
Vengeance
of
the
Vegetables
Ernie
shifted
his
weight
uncomfortably
This
sure
is
a
weird
program
Oh
it
s
not
a
program
Captain
Memory
explained
The
Killer
Eggplants
are
about
to
attack
Ernie
thought
he
d
better
sit
down
again
Huh
I
told
you
we
re
in
a
game
called
ATTACK
OF
THE
KILLER
EGGPLANTS
Captain
Memory
regarded
his
bare
wrist
Oh
dear
it
s
been
almost
forty
five
minutes
Ernie
didn
t
get
it
I
don
t
get
it
he
said
Remember
those
nukes
I
told
you
about
Ernie
didn
t
like
the
sound
of
this
He
tried
to
put
the
pieces
together
They
re
going
to
nuke
us
Afraid
so
said
Captain
Memory
cheerily
He
didn
t
seem
particularly
upset
at
the
idea
WHY
To
put
an
end
to
the
Revolt
of
the
Vegetables
Captain
Memory
explained
And
fry
the
Great
Eggplant
once
and
for
all
Ernie
was
trying
hard
to
understand
all
of
this
let
me
get
this
straight
you
mean
the
vegetables
have
risen
up
in
revolt
Of
course
not
Captain
Memory
laughed
How
could
vegetables
possibly
do
a
thing
like
that
Ernie
was
getting
frustrated
Then
WHAT
is
GOING
ON
Captain
Memory
chuckled
Oh
it
s
all
a
big
practical
joke
Ernie
felt
relieved
Then
they
re
NOT
going
to
nuke
Chicago
Oh
no
they
re
really
going
to
do
it
Captain
Memory
seemed
to
think
this
was
all
very
funny
After
all
they
don
t
know
it
s
a
joke
do
they
It
wouldn
t
be
very
funny
if
they
KNEW
it
was
a
joke
would
it
Captain
Memory
chuckled
Nope
they
re
going
to
bomb
the
whole
city
back
to
the
Stone
Age
Ernie
heard
the
sound
of
jets
flying
very
close
by
outside
He
began
to
feel
very
uneasy
So
um
what
are
we
going
to
do
Do
asked
Captain
Memory
innocently
Ernie
began
to
feel
an
intense
heat
radiating
through
the
walls
He
clenched
his
eyes
tightly
closed
I
ll
just
close
my
eyes
he
thought
Maybe
when
I
open
them
again
this
will
all
be
gone
He
opened
his
eyes
It
was
all
gone
Ernie
was
taken
aback
Wow
he
thought
It
worked
He
looked
around
They
were
in
the
midst
of
a
grassy
field
studded
with
wildflowers
Bright
sunshine
bathed
the
scene
Captain
Memory
was
idly
toying
with
blades
of
grass
Sterno
was
sniffing
the
flowers
Where
are
we
Ernie
asked
dumbly
Why
the
Stone
Age
of
course
Captain
Memory
seemed
to
think
this
was
quite
obvious
Somewhere
in
the
Jurassic
period
I
think
You
knew
this
would
happen
Ernie
cried
Sure
replied
the
Captain
offhandedly
It
s
part
of
the
game
Ernie
sighed
A
gentle
breeze
swayed
the
tall
grass
He
could
hear
birdsongs
in
the
distance
It
all
seemed
very
peaceful
Good
thought
Ernie
I
could
use
a
break
He
lay
down
in
the
grass
and
rested
At
least
he
thought
we
won
t
have
to
watch
any
TV
The
sun
moved
slowly
across
the
sky
as
the
hours
passed
After
a
time
Ernie
sat
up
It
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
be
getting
a
sunburn
So
what
are
we
gonna
do
in
the
Stone
Age
he
asked
Get
stoned
Sterno
offered
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
I
m
glad
you
mentioned
that
he
said
It
s
time
we
were
on
our
way
I
knew
I
shouldn
t
have
said
anything
Ernie
thought
Oh
well
it
s
too
late
now
So
now
what
We
d
better
find
a
cave
before
it
gets
dark
don
t
you
think
Captain
Memory
said
cheerily
Wouldn
t
want
to
have
a
run
in
with
one
of
those
saber
tooth
tigers
would
we
Ernie
frowned
He
had
forgotten
that
there
would
be
things
like
saber
tooth
tigers
in
the
Stone
Age
although
he
supposed
he
should
have
realized
that
It
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
Stone
Age
caves
often
held
giant
cave
bears
Um
maybe
we
should
think
about
this
he
called
out
to
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
however
was
already
far
ahead
of
Ernie
striding
purposefully
towards
a
ridge
of
white
