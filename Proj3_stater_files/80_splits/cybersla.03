at
the
dog
What
what
See
what
I
mean
the
Captain
gestured
towards
the
dog
In
Virtual
Reality
you
can
be
anybody
or
anything
You
re
lucky
you
came
through
as
yourself
You
could
have
wound
up
like
him
as
a
dog
The
dog
made
a
wry
expression
Yeah
right
Or
like
YOU
He
looked
the
Captain
up
and
down
A
super
hero
he
said
sarcastically
Captain
Memory
seemed
nonplussed
Well
what
s
wrong
with
that
I
m
sure
the
replied
Okay
what
super
powers
have
you
got
The
Captain
seemed
defensive
Well
I
do
have
some
powers
Like
what
Well
the
Captain
thought
a
moment
Like
I
program
in
Assembler
and
he
doesn
t
Wait
a
minute
Ernie
was
confused
WHO
doesn
t
Why
the
man
behind
all
this
of
course
the
Captain
explained
The
evil
genius
Waldo
Stadium
Oh
I
get
it
Ernie
brightened
This
really
is
a
game
right
Captain
Memory
sighed
exasperatedly
Look
for
the
last
time
this
is
NOT
a
game
The
evil
genius
Waldo
Stadium
has
embarked
on
a
plan
to
take
over
the
entire
world
s
computing
power
He
s
been
breaking
into
people
s
systems
one
at
a
time
taking
control
of
them
and
linking
them
to
his
other
systems
to
create
a
vast
network
that
grows
more
powerful
all
the
time
When
he
takes
over
a
system
he
establishes
complete
control
over
anything
and
anybody
that
happens
to
be
in
it
at
the
time
That
s
how
you
fell
into
his
clutches
He
s
taken
over
the
Virtual
Arcades
anyone
who
was
playing
a
Virtual
Reality
games
there
is
now
his
Cyberslave
Oh
man
Ernie
sank
his
head
into
his
hands
This
was
just
too
much
to
handle
Suddenly
a
thought
occurred
to
him
So
how
did
we
get
here
anyway
He
gestured
to
the
room
around
them
Captain
Memory
pulled
himself
up
to
his
full
height
I
brought
you
here
he
said
proudly
He
turned
to
the
dog
See
I
told
you
I
had
powers
Great
said
the
dog
sarcastically
So
where
are
we
anyway
We
re
in
Virtual
Reality
the
Captain
explained
You
know
Cyberspace
Wait
a
minute
Ernie
was
finding
this
all
hard
to
follow
If
we
re
still
in
the
computer
doesn
t
that
mean
that
this
guy
Waldo
Supermarket
has
control
over
us
Stadium
Captain
Memory
corrected
Whatever
Ernie
said
exasperatedly
What
about
my
question
Who
s
in
control
here
Ah
that
the
beauty
of
it
explained
the
Captain
warming
to
his
subject
He
s
been
taking
over
systems
so
fast
that
he
can
t
keep
track
of
them
He
doesn
t
even
know
what
he
s
got
Remember
when
he
takes
over
a
system
he
gets
EVERYTHING
that
was
in
it
He
s
got
games
spreadsheets
database
files
and
hundreds
of
different
Virtual
Realities
all
mixed
together
in
no
order
That
s
what
gives
us
our
window
of
opportunity
We
can
hide
out
in
areas
he
doesn
t
even
know
he
s
got
until
we
figure
out
how
to
bring
this
diabolical
scheme
to
a
halt
Ernie
thought
about
this
Okay
we
re
in
Cyberspace
Right
But
where
in
Cyberspace
The
Captain
slumped
Well
I
don
t
exactly
know
The
dog
snickered
Some
super
hero
Well
well
I
was
under
a
lot
of
pressure
The
Captain
said
defensively
Those
creatures
would
have
had
you
in
another
second
So
I
just
picked
a
location
at
random
and
JUMPed
to
it
You
JUMPed
to
it
Ernie
was
confused
How
do
you
do
that
That
s
the
beauty
of
Assembler
the
Captain
answered
enthusiastically
You
can
do
stuff
like
that
Now
with
a
high
level
language
you
d
never
be
able
to
do
stuff
like
that
You
can
only
do
what
the
language
says
you
can
do
In
Assembler
you
can
do
ANYTHING
Captain
Memory
chuckled
That
s
Waldo
s
weak
point
He
refuses
to
learn
Assembler
He
insists
you
can
do
all
this
stuff
in
C
or
whatever
language
he
using
now
Well
we
ll
show
Suddenly
the
dog
broke
in
At
RANDOM
he
barked
You
JUMPed
at
RANDOM
Well
the
Captain
was
taken
aback
You
mean
the
dog
continued
We
could
have
wound
up
in
the
middle
of
a
SPREADSHEET
Ernie
tried
to
imagine
life
in
a
spreadsheet
It
didn
t
sound
too
appealing
It
was
a
chance
I
had
to
take
Captain
Memory
explained
defensively
Great
the
dog
snarled
You
take
chances
with
our
lives
Okay
okay
the
Captain
said
placatingly
I
ve
got
a
better
location
He
rummaged
furiously
through
the
pockets
in
his
costume
I
wrote
it
down
it
s
here
somewhere
he
continued
searching
Um
no
um
AHA
He
brandished
a
small
slip
of
paper
in
the
air
Here
it
is
He
read
the
paper
aloud
It
s
INSPECTED
BY
NO
Some
super
hero
the
dog
repeated
The
Captain
frowned
Well
maybe
that
s
not
the
right
one
He
continued
to
rummage
through
his
pockets
I
m
sure
I
had
it
here
somewhere
Ernie
looked
askance
at
the
comic
book
character
You
don
t
REMEMBER
it
Captain
Memory
fidgeted
uncomfortably
Hey
it
s
not
easy
to
remember
a
long
string
of
numbers
in
Hex
you
know
I
m
doing
the
best
I
can
Ernie
moaned
quietly
This
was
all
