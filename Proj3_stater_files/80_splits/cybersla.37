the
Rasta
said
reassuringly
while
taking
out
a
monocle
and
fitting
it
into
his
eye
You

nothin
to
worry
about
We

Rastas
mon

He
laughed
Oh

The
Fly
was
giggling
uncontrollably
now
Hey
that
s
GREAT
music
he
said
enthusiastically
You
guys
are
really
alright
This
is
FUN
He
broke
down
into
fits
of
hysterical
giggling
Take
it
easy
mon
the
Rasta
said
to
Ernie
My
name
s
Jack
I

Sterno
stiffened
Monterey
Jack
Do

what
that
is
he
hissed
It
s
it
s
CHEESE
The
Rasta
stood
abruptly
up
the
monocle
dropping
out
of
his
eye
SEIZE
THEM
he
shrieked
his
Islands
accent
abruptly
vanishing
RUN
shouted
Ernie
and
Sterno
together
Hey
guys
what
s
the
rush
asked
the
Fly
his
head
lolling
from
side
to
side
Isn
t
this
a
FUN
party
Come
ON
Ernie
grabbed
the
Fly
s
tie
and
pulled
him
along
like
a
puppy
on
a
leash
The
ran
down
the
narrow
street
the
Fly
stumbling
and
giggling
Close
behind
them
were
the
imitation
Rastas
discarding
their
Caribbean
clothes
as
they
ran
to
reveal
Nazi
uniforms
beneath
Quick
in
here
Ernie
pulled
the
Fly
into
an
open
doorway
followed
by
Sterno
and
Captain
Memory
Inside
was
a
flight
of
stairs
They
ran
up
the
stairs
and
through
a
door
at
the
first
landing
to
find
themselves
in
a
long
corridor
lined
by
rows
of
doors
Looks
like
an
apartment
building
or
maybe
a
hotel
Ernie
observed
Maybe
we
can
find
a
room
to
hide
in
Good
idea
Sterno
agreed
I
d
like
a
room
with
a
TV
if
you
don
t
mind
Captain
Memory
added
Ernie
glared
at
him
and
hurried
down
the
hall
still
dragging
the
Fly
by
the
necktie
An
open
door
beckoned
The
four
rushed
into
what
appeared
to
be
an
ordinary
somewhat
run
down
hotel
room
slammed
the
door
behind
them
and
locked
it
Whew
Ernie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Well
I
don
t
think
they
can
find
us
in
here
Look
s
like
we
re
safe
The
Fly
collapsed
into
an
overstuffed
chair
He
held
his
hands
up
in
front
of
his
face
Oh
wow
he
said
wonderingly
Did
you
ever
look
at
your
hands
I
mean
really
LOOK
at
them
He
started
giggling
again
Hmmph
Sterno
sniffed
Some
people
just
can
t
hold
their
ganja
There
was
a
knock
on
the
door
Ssh
Ernie
cautioned
the
others
Let
s
just
be
quiet
and
they
won
t
know
we
re
in
here
Ve
know
you
re
in
dere
a
voice
outside
the
door
shouted
Ernie
was
astonished
How
could
they
know
we
were
in
here
he
whispered
to
the
others
Dat
s
easy
answered
the
voice
from
behind
them
door
Ve
just
follow
ze
trail
of
sequins
Ernie
looked
at
his
toreador
suit
Large
sparkle
less
patches
confirmed
his
worst
fears
Sure
enough
a
faint
but
clearly
identifiable
trail
of
sequins
led
under
the
door
Ernie
became
aware
of
everyone
glaring
at
him
except
of
course
the
Fly
who
was
still
busily
examining
his
hands
You
again
snarled
Sterno
Well
hey
Ernie
shrugged
defensively
What
am
I
supposed
to
do
you
know
I
The
knock
sounded
again
this
time
louder
Open
up
Ernie
looked
at
the
door
I
ll
be
cool
about
this
he
decided
Maybe
I
can
fake
them
out
Uh
yes
he
called
out
brightly
Who
s
there
Nazis
came
the
reply
Open
up
Uh
no
thanks
We
don
t
want
any
You
vill
open
zis
door
NOW
Ernie
thought
fast
Uh
I
m
in
the
bathroom
right
now
Could
you
come
back
later
BREAK
DOWN
ZE
DOOR
Something
large
and
heavy
thudded
into
the
door
Ernie
looked
around
the
room
frantically
The
fire
escape
Ernie
pointed
through
an
open
window
Quick
Everybody
Out
that
way
The
ran
to
the
window
and
climbed
down
the
fire
escape
Ernie
pulling
the
Fly
by
the
necktie
Hey
what
s
the
rush
guys
asked
the
Fly
giggling
We
just
got
here
As
they
hurried
down
the
fire
escape
Ernie
heard
the
sound
of
the
door
breaking
down
behind
them
After
zem
a
voice
cried
The
bottom
of
the
fire
escape
led
to
a
narrow
alley
Hurrying
along
it
the
found
themselves
facing
a
large
iron
door
There
was
no
other
way
out
of
the
alley
The
sounds
of
pursuit
were
close
behind
them
Ernie
tried
the
doorknob
It
was
unlocked
Quick
through
here
he
shouted
They
four
scrambled
through
the
door
and
slammed
it
behind
them
Inside
it
was
totally
dark
Ernie
felt
along
the
doorframe
for
a
lock
He
found
one
and
locked
it
He
found
another
and
locked
that
too
There
was
also
a
large
bolt
and
a
huge
padlock
He
locked
those
as
well
There
he
said
That
should
keep
them
out
We
re
safe
now
He
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Where
are
we
he
heard
Captain
Memory
s
voice
ask
I
can
t
see
a
thing
Ernie
inched
carefully
forward
his
hands
outstretched
hoping
to
find
a
lamp
or
a
light
switch
or
something
Suddenly
from
out
of
the
darkness
a
voice
rang
out
Ah
how
nice
