know
what
it
looks
like
but
it
doesn
t
look
like
Italy
It
s
pointless
to
argue
with
me
said
Sterno
pompously
Because
I
have
a
classical
education
and
I
am
therefore
always
right
Aren
t
there
supposed
to
be
like
grapes
and
pizzas
and
people
playing
those
little
accordions
Ernie
wondered
No
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
The
Fly
looked
down
the
road
into
the
valley
and
up
the
road
into
the
mountains
Okay
so
which
way
do
we
go
then
It
doesn
t
matter
said
Sterno
self
importantly
All
Roads
Lead
to
Rome
The
Fly
started
up
the
road
into
the
mountains
You
guys
can
go
any
way
you
want
he
called
back
over
his
shoulder
But
I
m
going
this
way
Why
Ernie
called
after
him
Cause
then
I
ll
be
in
Scotland
afore
ye
The
Fly
laughed
and
started
running
Last
one
there
is
a
rotten
egg
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
and
Sterno
Well
he
said
at
last
I
guess
we
might
as
well
follow
him
I
ll
say
Captain
Memory
agreed
I
wouldn
t
want
him
to
be
in
Scotland
afore
me
The
three
of
them
turned
and
began
walking
up
the
road
into
the
mountains
The
road
headed
upward
at
a
moderate
angle
making
walking
somewhat
difficult
They
began
to
notice
the
terrain
around
them
changing
as
they
walked
They
seemed
to
be
moving
into
a
cooler
moister
environment
The
desert
was
giving
way
to
cool
Alpine
meadows
The
road
narrowed
into
a
path
threading
it
s
way
between
the
growing
hills
Actually
Ernie
thought
It
s
kind
of
nice
here
Maybe
taking
the
high
road
was
a
good
idea
They
had
not
seen
the
Fly
for
quite
some
time
but
they
were
fairly
confident
that
he
was
just
a
bit
out
of
sight
ahead
of
them
since
they
could
hear
someone
singing
I
ll
take
the
high
road
in
the
distance
Suddenly
the
singing
stopped
Ernie
frowned
He
hoped
the
Fly
hadn
t
fallen
over
a
cliff
or
something
He
strained
his
ears
No
no
singing
Suddenly
he
heard
another
sound
Did
you
hear
that
he
said
to
Sterno
Of
course
said
Sterno
assuredly
Ernie
frowned
What
did
that
sound
like
to
you
I
believe
it
was
Yodellay
he
hoo
Sterno
replied
Ernie
knitted
his
brow
in
concentration
I
ve
heard
that
before
That
reminds
me
of
something
Like
what
asked
Sterno
with
a
slight
air
of
sarcasm
Fondue
perhaps
Chocolate
Watches
Heidi
Ernie
brightened
Switzerland
We
re
in
Switzerland
Very
good
applauded
Sterno
Go
to
the
head
of
the
class
Ernie
frowned
again
So
what
are
we
doing
in
Switzerland
Captain
Memory
shrugged
We
seem
to
have
wandered
into
somebody
s
Geography
program
So
now
what
We
go
on
to
Rome
of
course
Sterno
answered
confidently
Ernie
looked
at
the
rising
mountains
and
Alpine
meadows
around
them
Are
you
sure
we
re
going
the
right
way
I
mean
are
we
supposed
to
go
through
Switzerland
to
get
to
Rome
Of
course
said
Sterno
with
great
assurance
Don
t
you
remember
Hannibal
taking
his
elephants
through
the
Alps
on
his
way
to
Rome
Hannibal
Ernie
s
face
lit
up
with
recognition
I
saw
that
movie
Starring
Victor
Mature
right
Ernie
looked
at
the
narrow
path
on
which
they
stood
and
frowned
What
are
we
gonna
do
if
we
run
into
an
elephant
on
this
trail
At
that
moment
they
turned
a
corner
and
came
upon
the
Fly
who
was
standing
still
looking
at
something
Hi
guys
he
said
Take
a
look
at
this
The
trail
at
this
pointed
rounded
a
curve
at
the
top
of
a
cliff
The
Fly
pointed
over
the
side
into
the
valley
below
There
was
some
sort
of
commotion
going
on
in
the
valley
There
seemed
to
be
a
large
crowd
of
some
sort
moving
through
the
valley
carrying
torches
Ernie
peered
into
the
valley
There
were
a
lot
of
people
or
animals
or
something
moving
around
but
he
couldn
t
make
out
what
they
were
doing
Another
cattle
drive
he
suggested
I
doubt
it
remarked
Sterno
Look
at
all
those
torches
Must
be
a
torch
drive
the
Fly
said
brightly
Sterno
glared
at
the
Fly
and
muttered
something
unintelligible
Those
torches
sure
are
pretty
aren
t
they
commented
Captain
Memory
Maybe
we
should
go
down
and
join
the
party
Ernie
could
hear
some
kind
of
chanting
drifting
up
from
the
valley
He
strained
to
hear
what
they
were
saying
It
seemed
to
be
something
like
Oom
alla
boom
He
frowned
Somehow
he
just
didn
t
like
the
look
of
that
crowd
Uh
maybe
we
d
better
not
he
countered
Sterno
agreed
with
him
Maybe
another
time
the
dog
suggested
Captain
Memory
looked
at
the
others
You
guys
are
no
fun
he
complained
The
foursome
watched
the
commotion
below
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
continued
along
the
trail
The
narrow
trail
wound
along
between
huge
boulders
making
it
impossible
to
see
very
far
ahead
The
foursome
passed
through
a
narrow
opening
and
found
themselves
facing
a
large
open
field
which
seemed
to
stretch
on
for
miles
In
the
middle
of
this
space
was
a
large
English
style
mansion
surrounded
by
carefully
tended
grounds
The
foursome
approached
it
A
low
ornamental
fence
surrounded
the
