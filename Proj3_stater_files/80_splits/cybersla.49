them
my
brain
He
glared
at
the
horse
What
business
is
it
of
yours
anyway
Hey
The
Fly
interceded
Don
t
pick
on
Mr
Ed
He
stroked
the
horse
Nice
horsey
Why
not
give
them
your
brain
Sterno
suggested
You
never
use
it
Ernie
glared
Leave
me
alone
Ernie
looked
at
the
TV
Black
and
white
images
of
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
were
on
the
screen
Lucy
seemed
to
be
upset
about
something
What
are
we
watching
anyway
More
I
Love
Lucy
reruns
Captain
Memory
looked
at
the
TV
Guide
That
s
funny
This
is
supposed
to
be
a
movie
called
Nazi
Cheerleaders
from
Planet
X
Ernie
looked
at
the
TV
Oh
yeah
Who
s
in
it
Captain
Memory
consulted
the
TV
Guide
Let
me
see
uh
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
Ernie
frowned
I
dunno
It
looks
an
awful
lot
like
I
Love
Lucy
to
me
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Doesn
t
it
strike
you
as
just
a
little
bit
odd
that
absolutely
EVERYTHING
on
TV
right
now
has
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
in
it
No
I
don
t
think
that
s
odd
at
all
said
Mr
Ed
in
his
typical
low
voiced
drawl
Why
shouldn
t
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
be
in
everything
They
re
probably
the
two
greatest
performers
who
ever
lived
Huh
Ernie
didn
t
know
how
to
answer
that
In
fact
Mr
Ed
went
on
rapturously
I
d
say
that
they
are
definitely
the
finest
performers
that
show
business
has
ever
produced
the
greatest
that
ever
COULD
be
produced
in
fact
in
all
of
time
and
space
no
one
anywhere
in
the
universe
could
possibly
even
approach
the
greatness
of
Lucille
Ball
and
Desi
Arnaz
Oh
come
off
it
snapped
Sterno
irritatedly
They
re
just
a
couple
of
second
rate
TV
actors
Ay
carramba
Mr
Ed
cried
furiously
What
chu
talkin
about
Dey
de
greatest
Especialmente
Desi
Arnaz
de
greatest
Cuban
bandleader
in
de
world
Ernie
looked
at
Mr
Ed
suspiciously
Hey
what
happened
to
your
voice
Where
did
you
get
that
Cuban
accent
Mr
Ed
was
flustered
Hey
man
I
uh
oh
Something
very
peculiar
seemed
to
be
happening
to
Mr
Ed
He
seemed
to
be
writhing
in
a
very
un
horselike
manner
Suddenly
Mr
Ed
fell
in
half
Both
halves
lay
on
the
floor
each
writhing
independently
Ernie
was
stunned
He
stared
at
the
two
halves
of
Mr
Ed
jaws
open
with
astonishment
Suddenly
a
head
covered
with
rolled
red
curls
popped
out
of
the
back
half
of
Mr
Ed
Oh
uh
hi
guys
It
was
Lucy
Lucy
turned
to
the
front
half
of
Mr
Ed
which
was
still
writhing
on
the
floor
Oh
Ricky
I
told
you
to
let
me
be
the
front
half
of
the
horse
Now
look
what
s
happened
A
voice
came
from
the
front
half
of
Mr
Ed
Lucy
I
stuck
in
dis
horse
suit
Help
me
out
okay
The
front
half
of
Mr
Ed
thrashed
wildly
filling
the
room
with
the
sound
of
thuds
and
maracas
Lucy
struggled
out
of
her
half
of
the
horse
suit
and
ran
over
to
help
Ricky
However
the
more
she
tried
to
help
him
the
more
tangled
up
he
got
The
Fly
looked
ruefully
at
the
horse
suit
Poor
Mr
Ed
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Now
what
The
Captain
was
still
reading
his
TV
Guide
How
about
She
Devils
of
Green
Gables
with
Shirley
Temple
and
He
was
interrupted
by
a
loud
pounding
on
the
door
Open
up
They
all
looked
up
startled
The
pounding
came
again
Open
da
door
punk
I
know
you
re
in
dere
Lucy
turned
to
Ricky
who
was
still
stuck
in
the
horse
suit
Oh
Ricky
It
s
Vito
Let
him
in
will
you
Maybe
he
can
get
our
brain
from
that
awful
Ernie
person
She
glared
at
Ernie
Ricky
struggled
in
the
horse
outfit
You
got
to
get
me
out
of
here
He
cried
distressed
I
can
t
see
nuttin
in
dis
suit
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
I
think
we
ought
to
get
out
of
here
okay
The
Captain
continued
to
peruse
his
TV
Guide
Oh
you
ll
like
this
one
A
Funny
Thing
Happened
on
the
Way
to
Attila
the
Hun
with
Zero
Mostel
and
Ernie
paced
anxiously
Look
we
ve
got
to
do
something
All
these
people
are
after
my
brain
Sterno
shrugged
Call
the
police
Ernie
started
The
police
That
was
worth
a
try
He
grabbed
the
phone
and
dialed
Ernie
fidgeted
impatiently
while
the
phone
rang
He
heard
the
sound
of
the
phone
being
taken
off
the
hook
You
gotta
help
me
he
began
He
stopped
The
voice
on
the
other
end
was
a
recording
We
re
sorry
all
of
our
officers
are
busy
at
the
moment
If
you
re
being
murdered
please
leave
a
clue
and
one
of
our
detectives
will
contact
your
next
of
kin
as
soon
as
possible
Thank
you
and
have
a
nice
day
Ernie
slammed
the
phone
down
disgustedly
Vito
pounded
on
the
door
again
Open
up
Ernie
looked
apprehensively
at
Ricky
who
was
still
struggling
to
get
out
of
the
horse
suit
Look
I
really
think
we
ought
to
get
out
of
here
Like
NOW
Captain
Memory
looked
up
in
annoyance
Well
if
you
re
going
to
