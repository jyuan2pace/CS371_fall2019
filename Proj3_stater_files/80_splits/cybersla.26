the
magazine
convinced
that
they
were
onto
something
What
trash
Sterno
dropped
the
magazine
in
the
wastebasket
Hey
Ernie
fished
through
the
wastebasket
trying
to
retrieve
the
magazine
Oh
no
it
s
all
covered
with
sticky
wine
The
pages
are
all
stuck
together
Wow
man
said
the
Fly
wonderingly
That
s
really
heavy
stuff
Imagine
that
Princess
Diana
pregnant
with
Elvis
s
baby
I
never
knew
that
Ernie
was
trying
to
separate
the
pages
of
the
magazine
but
the
Mad
Dog
wine
had
dissolved
most
of
the
ink
and
he
was
only
succeeding
in
making
a
big
mess
Did
you
really
think
you
were
going
to
find
the
secrets
of
the
universe
in
that
magazine
asked
Sterno
sarcastically
I
don
t
think
you
re
going
to
get
anywhere
with
that
stuff
added
Captain
Memory
I
think
you
re
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
I
suppose
you
think
that
s
funny
Sterno
snarled
He
regarded
Ernie
for
a
moment
You
know
that
little
hat
looks
really
ridiculous
Yeah
guy
the
Fly
chimed
in
How
come
you
re
wearing
that
Mickey
Mouse
hat
It
s
not
a
Mickey
Mouse
hat
alright
said
Ernie
frustrated
It
s
part
of
the
outfit
You
re
supposed
to
wear
this
kind
of
a
little
hat
I
dunno
why
you
re
just
supposed
to
Ernie
sulked
Leave
me
alone
Sterno
chuckled
The
only
good
thing
about
having
him
along
he
said
gesturing
at
Ernie
Is
that
he
can
always
cheer
me
up
If
I
didn
t
have
him
to
laugh
at
I
don
t
know
WHAT
I
d
do
Ernie
glowered
The
Fly
was
sitting
at
a
dressing
table
regarding
himself
in
the
mirror
He
kept
examining
various
bottle
of
cosmetics
holding
each
in
turn
up
to
his
face
but
he
couldn
t
find
any
that
matched
his
shell
tone
My
what
big
eyes
you
have
quipped
Sterno
How
about
some
eyeliner
Or
maybe
some
mascara
for
your
antenna
Aw
c
mon
guys
the
Fly
complained
Gimme
a
break
huh
I
was
just
looking
for
a
little
like
bronzer
y
know
Y
think
bronzer
would
look
good
on
me
His
antennae
waved
hopefully
Ernie
was
feeling
irritable
He
was
tired
of
everyone
picking
on
him
all
the
time
Why
do
you
keep
reading
that
TV
Guide
he
snapped
at
Captain
Memory
So
I
can
see
what
s
on
answered
the
Captain
reasonably
How
can
you
possibly
tell
what
s
on
when
you
don
t
even
know
where
we
are
You
re
never
gonna
have
the
right
listings
for
here
wherever
THIS
is
Sure
I
do
disagreed
the
Captain
I
ve
got
the
listings
for
everywhere
How
could
you
have
that
Ernie
was
skeptical
This
is
the
Inter
Continuum
Edition
with
Multi
Galactic
Sub
Listings
for
the
week
of
May
Infinity
explained
the
Captain
It
s
got
the
listings
for
all
of
Time
and
Space
Lemme
see
that
Ernie
snatched
it
rudely
out
of
Captain
Memory
s
hand
Why
the
pages
are
all
blank
Are
you
a
subscriber
the
Captain
wanted
to
know
gently
taking
the
book
back
out
of
Ernie
s
hands
Well
no
Ernie
admitted
Well
that
s
why
you
can
t
see
it
Ernie
sighed
He
guessed
that
made
as
much
sense
as
anything
else
CM
examined
the
listings
carefully
Wanna
watch
an
old
movie
Here
s
a
classic
Mr
Blandings
Builds
his
Dream
Horse
Ernie
frowned
You
mean
House
Captain
Memory
was
puzzled
Mr
House
Builds
his
Dream
Horse
Ernie
shook
his
head
No
no
It
s
supposed
to
be
Mr
Blandings
Builds
his
Dream
House
Captain
Memory
peered
at
the
TV
Guide
It
quite
clearly
says
here
Horse
That
s
ridiculous
Ernie
insisted
You
can
t
build
a
horse
That
s
right
the
Fly
chimed
in
At
least
not
without
a
permit
Huh
Ernie
was
taken
aback
And
an
inspection
the
Fly
went
on
I
mean
you
wouldn
t
want
to
ride
a
horse
that
was
built
without
a
permit
and
wasn
t
inspected
It
wouldn
t
be
safe
Uh
Something
about
this
didn
t
sound
right
to
Ernie
The
Fly
continued
with
enthusiasm
I
mean
like
what
if
you
took
this
horse
out
on
the
freeway
you
know
and
you
re
cruisin
along
doin
maybe
and
all
of
a
sudden
boom
A
leg
falls
off
Then
what
Somebody
could
get
hurt
Ernie
didn
t
know
how
to
argue
with
this
Uh
I
suppose
you
re
right
He
fell
silent
Captain
Memory
broke
the
silence
Hey
here
s
a
good
show
Follow
the
Yellow
Brick
Road
The
Fab
Four
stop
for
a
drink
at
The
Deer
Bar
and
meet
aliens
disguised
as
s
TV
characters
Starring
Lucille
Ball
Adam
West
and
Rin
Tin
Tin
How
about
that
Sounds
okay
to
me
said
the
Fly
agreeably
Ernie
looked
around
the
room
There
s
no
TV
he
said
triumphantly
Oh
there
s
always
a
TV
the
Captain
assured
him
Okay
where
Ernie
demanded
Hmm
Captain
Memory
looked
around
He
got
up
walked
over
to
the
dressing
table
and
peered
into
the
mirror
Let
s
try
this
Mirror
mirror
on
the
wall
Ain
t
there
no
TV
at
all
The
surface
of
the
mirror
dissolved
and
an
image
of
The
Deer
Bar
appeared
in
its
place
Four
characters
were
seated
at
the
bar
