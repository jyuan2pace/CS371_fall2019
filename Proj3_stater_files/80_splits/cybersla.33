they
found
out
boy
were
they
mad
Captain
Memory
chuckled
Of
course
it
isn
t
really
funny
if
it
doesn
t
make
somebody
mad
is
it
That
s
what
practical
jokes
are
all
about
Captain
Memory
paused
But
anyway
all
of
this
should
be
taking
place
just
about
he
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
Now
A
sound
like
that
of
distant
thunder
shook
the
house
Ernie
looked
out
the
window
Chicago
he
asked
Yup
answered
the
Captain
There
it
goes
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Did
they
nuke
Chicago
twice
Why
would
they
want
to
do
something
like
that
Captain
Memory
wondered
Once
you
nuke
it
it
stays
nuked
Well
in
that
case
Ernie
pondered
How
could
we
be
in
Chicago
just
before
it
got
nuked
before
when
we
re
here
just
before
it
got
nuked
now
Captain
Memory
frowned
That
is
confusing
isn
t
it
I
ve
never
quite
figured
that
out
The
Captain
didn
t
seem
overly
upset
about
the
problem
Ernie
decided
that
it
probably
wouldn
t
be
good
for
him
to
think
about
that
problem
anymore
He
decided
to
think
about
something
else
So
what
ever
happened
to
that
practical
joker
that
Andreas
Whats
His
Name
he
asked
As
if
in
answer
to
this
question
a
figure
burst
through
the
door
It
was
an
older
man
with
a
wild
white
beard
and
hair
His
clothes
were
in
tatters
and
he
was
covered
with
splotches
of
egg
rotten
tomatoes
and
other
things
too
disgusting
to
think
about
Hide
me
hide
me
he
implored
They
re
after
me
They
ll
tear
me
to
pieces
It
was
just
a
joke
I
didn
t
know
they
d
take
it
seriously
It
was
just
a
practical
joke
Well
Ernie
began
Suddenly
the
man
seemed
to
see
Ernie
clearly
for
the
first
time
A
BULLFIGHTER
He
looked
at
Captain
Memory
A
comic
book
character
He
looked
at
the
Fly
A
GIANT
FLY
What
IS
your
problem
Sterno
demanded
A
TALKING
DOG
the
man
shrieked
You
re
all
worse
than
me
I
ve
got
to
get
out
of
here
They
ll
tear
you
all
to
pieces
With
that
the
man
threw
himself
through
the
nearest
window
which
luckily
had
been
glazed
with
large
panes
of
sugar
instead
of
glass
He
sprinted
towards
a
group
of
trees
behind
the
house
and
disappeared
into
a
large
hole
beneath
one
of
them
Ernie
thought
he
saw
a
large
white
rabbit
with
a
watch
disappear
into
the
hole
as
well
but
he
wasn
t
sure
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
I
d
really
like
to
get
a
watch
he
commented
It
doesn
t
have
to
be
anything
fancy
A
Timex
would
be
okay
The
Fly
was
looking
out
the
door
Uh
oh
he
said
ominously
Here
they
come
Here
WHO
comes
Ernie
demanded
anxiously
The
angry
villagers
the
Fly
said
unhappily
You
know
with
the
torches
and
the
rocks
and
everything
You
don
t
want
to
mess
with
the
angry
villagers
man
They
re
mean
They
Fly
shuddered
He
seemed
to
have
had
some
kind
of
bad
experience
with
them
in
the
past
Uh
maybe
we
ought
to
get
out
of
here
Ernie
suggested
I
haven
t
finished
my
strawberry
mousse
Sterno
said
petulantly
Oh
man
I
don
t
know
what
we
re
gonna
do
said
the
Fly
miserably
They
re
closing
in
on
us
from
all
sides
Ernie
peered
through
the
broken
window
He
could
see
the
smoke
from
their
torches
in
the
distance
It
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
they
should
barricade
the
door
or
something
Unfortunately
the
door
had
already
been
broken
off
its
hinges
by
the
Nazis
Ernie
put
it
upright
in
the
doorframe
as
best
he
could
and
shoved
a
small
rocking
chair
up
against
it
to
hold
it
I
don
t
think
that
s
gonna
stop
anybody
the
Fly
said
glumly
Ernie
could
hear
angry
shouts
The
villagers
were
approaching
fast
I
think
we
better
do
something
Ernie
urged
Captain
Memory
Oh
yeah
Captain
Memory
looked
up
unconcernedly
Like
what
With
a
crash
a
rock
came
sailing
through
on
of
the
unbroken
windows
The
angry
shouts
were
quite
close
now
Ernie
couldn
t
understand
them
though
They
seemed
to
be
in
German
A
burning
torch
came
sailing
through
an
open
window
Another
landed
just
outside
the
door
Thick
black
smoke
began
to
fill
the
air
Ew
burning
sugar
complained
Sterno
How
rank
The
Fly
peeked
out
a
window
Oh
man
those
angry
villagers
They
re
bad
news
Hey
this
place
is
burning
up
Ernie
urged
Captain
Memory
We
ve
got
to
DO
something
Captain
Memory
made
a
wry
face
Well
I
guess
there
s
no
point
in
hanging
around
HERE
anymore
He
thought
a
moment
Let
s
try
F
D
The
scene
vanished
Blinking
Ernie
found
himself
once
again
in
an
entirely
different
place
He
staggered
and
his
stomach
flip
flopped
Oh
man
he
moaned
I
don
t
know
if
I
can
take
these
sudden
changes
of
scene
anymore
Oh
Captain
Memory
seemed
surprised
Would
you
rather
be
back
at
the
gingerbread
cottage
Ernie
straightened
up
abruptly
No
no
that
s
okay
I
m
fine
just
fine
I
d
just
as
soon
be
right
um
He
looked
around
Captain
Memory
the
Fly
and
Sterno
were
all
looking
