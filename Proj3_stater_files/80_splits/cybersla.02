you
Like
you
they
thought
they
were
going
to
play
a
game
The
next
thing
they
knew
they
were
forced
into
a
life
of
virtual
hard
labor
operating
mining
robots
hours
a
day
days
a
week
until
finally
their
bodies
shrivelled
up
and
their
brains
burned
out
He
sighed
I
was
too
late
for
most
of
them
but
at
least
I
could
save
the
two
of
you
Ernie
shivered
Some
of
this
was
beginning
to
seem
a
little
too
real
Man
this
is
a
really
strange
game
he
said
I
m
not
complaining
mind
you
I
mean
the
special
effects
alone
make
it
worth
the
money
He
looked
around
He
seemed
to
be
in
a
huge
living
room
all
decorated
in
s
style
It
all
seemed
very
solid
and
believable
Ernie
couldn
t
help
being
impressed
I
mean
this
is
like
SO
realistic
It
s
just
that
I
m
having
a
real
hard
time
following
the
story
Like
what
is
supposed
to
be
happening
in
this
game
anyway
Captain
Memory
sighed
Look
I
m
trying
to
explain
this
to
you
It
s
NOT
a
game
okay
That
game
business
was
just
a
ruse
It
was
a
trap
to
get
you
to
come
in
and
hook
yourself
up
to
their
Virtual
Reality
system
Once
you
re
in
you
can
t
get
out
They
turn
you
into
a
Cyberslave
and
make
you
work
until
your
brain
burns
up
Oh
right
Ernie
caught
himself
I
get
it
You
re
not
supposed
to
admit
it
s
a
game
You
re
supposed
to
pretend
it
s
real
Okay
I
ll
play
along
So
what
now
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
I
can
see
this
isn
t
going
to
be
easy
He
thought
a
moment
Okay
if
this
is
a
game
you
should
be
able
to
quit
any
time
you
like
right
Uh
yeah
This
was
beginning
to
make
Ernie
uneasy
So
how
do
you
quit
the
Captain
demanded
Where
s
the
ESC
button
or
BREAK
or
whatever
HOW
do
you
get
out
Ernie
suddenly
realized
that
he
hadn
t
been
given
any
information
on
what
to
do
when
he
wanted
to
quit
playing
Uh
well
I
can
quit
anytime
I
want
he
said
defensively
Okay
try
Captain
Memory
demanded
Ernie
shuffled
uncomfortably
Well
maybe
I
m
not
ready
to
quit
yet
Try
it
just
to
see
what
happens
the
Captain
urged
Well
Ernie
considered
It
looks
like
I
got
into
the
wrong
game
here
I
wanted
to
play
GOOMBAH
THE
BARBARIAN
I
mean
no
offense
this
is
a
cool
game
and
everything
but
I
really
wanted
to
play
GOOMBAH
Captain
Memory
looked
upset
This
really
isn
t
a
game
Ernie
sighed
I
ll
tell
you
what
I
ll
just
give
up
on
this
for
today
and
I
ll
try
again
a
week
from
Thursday
okay
So
I
ll
just
be
heading
home
now
okay
Great
said
the
Captain
enthusiastically
Just
quit
right
now
okay
Well
okay
Ernie
agreed
halfheartedly
He
tried
to
think
of
what
to
do
Hello
he
called
up
into
the
air
Is
anybody
there
I
d
like
to
go
now
Nothing
happened
Ernie
s
heart
began
to
pound
Hey
c
mon
Isn
t
anybody
listening
to
me
I
said
I
wanna
GO
No
response
This
was
beginning
to
be
more
than
Ernie
felt
he
could
deal
with
Look
I
m
not
asking
for
my
money
back
or
anything
I
ll
you
know
try
again
some
other
time
I
just
want
to
go
home
okay
No
answer
Now
Ernie
really
DID
want
to
go
He
began
to
panic
Hey
isn
t
anybody
out
there
WAKE
UP
I
don
t
wanna
play
anymore
I
wanna
go
home
He
wailed
I
WANT
MY
MOMMY
Nothing
All
right
all
right
calm
down
Captain
Memory
tried
to
soothe
Ernie
We
ll
get
you
out
of
here
It
s
just
going
to
take
a
little
time
Ernie
s
left
arm
unfroze
convulsively
dumping
the
little
dog
on
the
floor
It
growled
unpleasantly
Why
can
t
you
get
me
out
of
here
NOW
he
demanded
petulantly
The
Captain
shrugged
Hey
I
don
t
run
this
show
I
was
lucky
I
could
even
get
you
away
from
those
creatures
Getting
out
is
another
story
altogether
Oh
this
is
awful
Ernie
wailed
He
still
wasn
t
entirely
sure
whether
this
was
a
game
or
not
but
whatever
it
was
he
didn
t
like
it
anymore
Maybe
you
d
better
sit
down
Captain
Memory
moved
over
to
one
side
of
the
sofa
Ernie
decided
that
sitting
down
was
probably
a
good
idea
and
did
so
This
was
beginning
to
get
altogether
too
real
Anyway
it
could
be
worse
How
Ernie
moaned
You
could
be
like
that
poor
guy
over
there
the
Captain
said
gesturing
towards
the
dog
I
don
t
need
your
sympathy
the
dog
snapped
Ernie
started
A
talking
dog
This
is
unbelievable
What
next
Yeah
yeah
the
dog
snarled
Believe
me
you
don
t
look
so
hot
in
that
ridiculous
fur
loincloth
either
Goombah
the
Barbarian
I
m
sure
The
dog
pulled
a
cigar
out
of
some
invisible
pocket
and
began
to
smoke
it
holding
it
in
his
front
paw
in
a
very
un
canine
manner
Ernie
was
suddenly
very
conscious
of
his
loincloth
He
looked
