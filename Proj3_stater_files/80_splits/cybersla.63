Sing
von
Liederkranz
commanded
ferociously
The
Nazi
s
resumed
singing
with
feigned
enthusiasm
PUTTINK
ON
DER
RITZ
I
knew
it
the
Fly
enthused
I
knew
it
was
Fred
Astaire
That
means
I
win
right
Von
Liederkranz
and
the
Nazis
began
dancing
gracelessly
towards
the
door
that
led
to
the
hallway
singing
Dum
de
dum
de
dum
dum
since
they
couldn
t
remember
the
rest
of
the
words
Bravo
Sterno
applauded
enthusiastically
Keep
it
up
you
re
doing
great
Von
Liederkranz
grinned
broadly
and
began
dancing
with
greater
enthusiasm
although
no
better
rhythm
He
headed
out
the
door
and
down
the
hall
the
Nazi
chorus
line
crowding
awkwardly
behind
him
Fabulous
Sterno
enthused
He
signalled
to
Ernie
the
Fly
and
Captain
Memory
who
caught
the
hint
and
began
applauding
as
well
Wonderful
Tremendous
they
all
cheered
The
Nazi
s
voices
began
receding
down
the
hall
Sterno
gestured
towards
the
French
doors
leading
to
the
outside
The
four
got
up
and
began
tiptoeing
towards
them
Suddenly
the
heard
a
resounding
crash
coming
from
down
the
hall
Dummkopf
Schweinhund
cried
a
voice
followed
by
the
snap
of
a
riding
crop
RUN
cried
Sterno
The
foursome
charged
through
the
French
doors
and
went
sprinting
across
the
field
behind
the
house
In
a
few
moments
the
English
Tudor
mansion
was
out
of
view
Peculiarly
enough
as
soon
as
they
left
the
mansion
it
was
mid
afternoon
again
The
darkness
seemed
to
have
been
confined
to
the
study
The
four
slowed
down
to
a
walk
exhausted
and
out
of
breath
Ernie
looked
back
There
was
no
sign
of
pursuit
Looks
like
they
re
still
trying
to
get
their
act
together
Captain
Memory
commented
That
act
has
got
let
s
say
a
few
rough
spots
that
need
to
be
ironed
out
Sterno
snickered
I
think
they
re
going
to
be
working
on
it
for
rather
a
long
time
Ernie
sighed
with
relief
Those
Nazis
made
him
very
uneasy
The
four
continued
walking
They
were
in
the
midst
of
what
seemed
to
be
many
acres
of
lush
grassy
meadow
A
short
distance
ahead
Ernie
spotted
flock
of
sheep
peacefully
grazing
Sheep
Ernie
exclaimed
Really
Sterno
asked
sarcastically
How
clever
of
you
to
figure
that
out
A
small
group
of
sheep
detached
themselves
from
the
flock
and
walked
up
to
the
foursome
Ernie
noticed
that
they
looked
much
like
the
other
sheep
in
the
flock
except
for
the
fact
that
they
were
wearing
dark
sunglasses
Looking
closely
he
could
see
that
some
of
them
seemed
to
be
carrying
some
objects
that
looked
a
lot
like
hmm
well
like
surfboards
Baa
the
first
sheep
said
as
if
in
greeting
Baa
Baa
Sterno
replied
The
sheep
seemed
to
respond
favorably
to
this
You
speak
their
language
Ernie
was
astounded
Of
course
Sterno
replied
offhandedly
I
was
always
a
great
student
of
foreign
languages
But
what
language
do
they
speak
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Sheepish
of
course
Sterno
replied
in
a
patronizing
tone
Everybody
knows
THAT
The
lead
sheep
continued
Baa
Baa
Baa
Ba
inquired
Sterno
Baa
Baa
Baa
the
lead
sheep
repeated
vigorously
A
second
later
the
next
sheep
repeated
the
same
thing
Baa
Baa
Baa
And
then
the
next
sheep
picked
up
the
refrain
soon
they
were
all
chanting
Baa
Baa
Baa
Suddenly
the
lead
sheep
launched
into
the
main
verse
Baa
Baa
Baa
Baa
Barbara
Ann
Oh
it
s
the
Beach
Sheep
the
Fly
exclaimed
By
now
the
entire
group
of
sheep
had
launched
into
the
song
in
full
chorus
They
re
not
bad
admitted
Ernie
Even
the
President
likes
the
Beach
Sheep
the
Fly
asserted
Of
course
they
re
not
really
the
Beach
Sheep
Sterno
explained
They
re
not
the
Fly
seemed
very
disappointed
Don
t
be
silly
Sterno
sniggered
You
couldn
t
expect
the
real
Beach
Sheep
to
be
performing
in
a
little
out
of
the
way
meadow
like
this
could
you
The
only
play
the
really
big
fields
nowadays
Aww
The
Fly
s
antennae
drooped
No
continued
Sterno
They
re
just
one
of
a
whole
flock
of
Beach
Sheep
impersonators
A
good
imitation
but
not
the
real
thing
Ernie
thought
a
moment
You
mean
like
Elvis
impersonators
The
Sheepish
equivalent
Sterno
agreed
Having
finished
their
song
the
Beach
Sheep
began
discussing
something
with
Sterno
in
very
serious
tones
Ernie
of
course
couldn
t
understand
a
bleat
of
it
since
it
was
all
in
Sheepish
So
what
s
the
deal
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
It
seems
the
sheep
have
a
problem
Sterno
explained
They
re
being
oppressed
by
one
of
their
own
kind
a
cruel
tyrant
who
will
stop
at
nothing
to
get
his
own
way
Gee
that
s
tough
the
Fly
shook
his
head
sadly
What
s
this
tyrant
called
anyway
Ernie
was
curious
Sterno
paused
dramatically
They
call
him
the
Wooly
Bully
Ernie
frowned
That
name
seemed
somehow
familiar
to
him
The
Fly
started
snapping
his
fingers
and
humming
Wooly
bully
wooly
bully
Will
you
STOP
that
barked
Sterno
Have
some
respect
please
This
is
a
serious
problem
Oh
Sorry
The
Fly
fell
silent
Sterno
continued
conversing
with
the
sheep
They
re
asking
our
help
in
breaking
free
of
this
awful
tyranny
Wooly
Bully
that
reminds
me
of
something
Captain
Memory
became
thoughtful
The
Hully
Gully
perhaps
The
Fly
