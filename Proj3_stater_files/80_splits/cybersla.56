Dere

Whoa
He
stopped

map
and
began
regarding
it
carefully
Ah

at
Heidelberg
The
other
Romans
had
removed
their
togas
as
well
and
stood
revealed
as
Nazi
SS
troopers
One
of
them
peered
over
von
Liederkranz
s
shoulder
Uh
Herr
Sturmbannfuhrer
he
began
tentatively
Dat
s
a
map
of
Bavaria
Von
Liederkranz
started
He
looked
at
the
legend
of
the
map
and
then
crumpled
it
up
angrily
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
I
know
dat

snapped

He
prodded
the
SS
trooper
with
his
riding
crop
Okay

The

regarded

carefully

a
minute
Uh

He
wheeled
the
chariot
around
and
they
galloped
off
in
the
other
direction
They
charged
on
down
the
yellow
brick
road
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
in
the
first
place
moving
faster
this
time
as
von
Liederkranz
whipped
the
horses
bad
temperedly
After
some
time
they
began
to
approach
what
seemed
to
be
a
town
Oh
wow
said
the
Fly
It
s
the
same
town
How
did
we
get
to
the
same
place
when

smirked
Sterno
All

Rome
You

There

Von
Liederkranz
peered
ahead
Gottverdammter
Vhere

He
pulled
out
another
map
and
regarded
it
carefully
Ah
Here

I

at
Indianapolis
The
SS
trooper
looked
over
von
Liederkranz
s
shoulder
again
Uh
Herr
Sturmbannfuhrer
dat
s
a
map
of
Illinois
Von
Liederkranz
started
He
quickly
crumpled
up
the
map
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
I
know
dat
He
turned
to
the
rest
of
the
group
Ve

going
to
zis
town
Ve
intended
to
go
to
zis
town
It
vas
NOT
a
mistake
They
continued
down
the
road
and
into
town
The
town
consisted
of
one
unpaved
road
flanked
by
one
story
wooden
buildings
with
broad
fronts
Their
names
were
clearly
legible
on
them
SALOON
GENERAL
STORE
U
S
MARSHAL
The
town
looked
somehow
familiar
to
Ernie
Oh

exclaimed
the
Fly
It
s
Dodge
City
That
s
impossible
snorted
Sterno
You

t
have
All

City
That

classical
education

mused
Ernie
All
Roads
Lead
to
Abilene
said
Sterno
sarcastically
Fat
chance
You
must
be
right
Ernie
agreed
I
don
t
see
any
cattle
around
Must
be
Dodge
City
after
all
As
they
passed
through
town
Ernie
noticed
a
tall
thin
young
man
who
looked
at
them
with
alarm
The
young
man
began
hurrying
towards
the
U
S
Marshal
s
office
walking
with
a
pronounced
limp
Mr
Dillon
Mr
Dillon
Somethin
strange
comin
into

he
cried
A
tall
imposing
man
dressed
in
Western
attire
and
wearing
a
U
S
Marshal
badge
stepped
out
of
the
marshal
s
office
and
into
the
street
blocking
the
path
of
the
chariot
Hold

town
Get

von
Liederkranz
I

shtupidity
Now

just
a
minute
there
the
Marshal
began
Idiot
snapped
von
Liederkranz
He
turned
to
the
SS
troopers
Disintegrate
him
von
Liederkranz
and
the
SS
troopers
reached
for
their
evil
looking
weapons
With
lightning
speed
the
Marshal
s
gun
flew
into
his
hand
Four
shots
rand
out
catching
each
of
the
Nazis
full
in
the
chest
the
force
of
the
bullet
hurling
their
bodies
from
the
chariot
I
seen
it
Mr
Dillon
cried
Chester
the
young
man
with
the
limp
They
drew
first
Ernie
threw
his
hands
up
over
his
head
Don
t
shoot
We
re
unarmed
Sterno
get
down
on
all

Woof
he
said
emphatically
They

t
shoot
dogs

they
They
were
holding
us
prisoner
the
Fly
chimed
in
They
shot
Ben
Hur
Ben
who
The
Marshal
looked
confused
Just
then
a
woman
in
an
elaborate
red
dress
ran
out
of
the
saloon
Oh
Matt
Are
you
all
right
I
heard
the
shooting
Don
t
you
worry
Miss
Kitty
I
m
just
fine
the
Marshal
reassured
her
Ernie
looked
at
the
ground
behind
him
The
bloody
bodies
of
von
Liederkranz
and
the
other
Nazis
were
lying
motionless
in
the
dust
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Are
they
really
dead
Oh
yes
said
Captain
Memory
cheerfully
Too
bad
they
won
t
stay
that
way
Huh
Ernie
was
confused
Well
you
know
how
it
is
in
computer
games
the
Captain
went
on
If
you
get
killed
you
just
start
over
again
with
another
life
I
dunno
they
looked
pretty
dead
to
me
Ernie
said
Look
again
the
Captain
advised
Ernie
turned
The
bodies
had
vanished
