t
seem
proper
to
Ernie
Certainly
it
was
very
un
British
Ernie
frowned
Then
on
the
other
hand
it
wasn
t
his
fault
Lord
Foofaraw
was
the
one
who
served
the
lamb
chops
They
shouldn
t
serve
lamb
chops
if
they
don
t
want
people
to
eat
them
And
anyway
they
didn
t
give
him
any
utensils
so
he
had
to
eat
them
with
his
hands
That
settled
Ernie
returned
to
stuffing
his
face
with
chops
Pip
pip
Cheerio
Eh
wot
said
Lord
Foofaraw
jovially
How
very
British
exclaimed
Sterno
delightedly
Rather
agreed
Lord
Foofaraw
Ernie
turned
to
the
nobleman
I
wonder
if
you
could
tell
us
where
we
are
he
managed
to
ask
between
bites
Where
you
ARE
Lord
Foofaraw
seemed
amazed
Why
I
should
think
that
would
be
quite
obvious
You
re
HERE
old
boy
Sterno
chuckled
The
Fly
waved
his
antennae
confusedly
Captain
Memory
continued
to
look
around
for
a
TV
Lord
Foofaraw
settled
comfortably
into
an
overstuffed
chair
Ah
yes
he
began
This
reminds
me
of
the
time
I
was
lost
in
the
jungles
of
Poodawumpus
surrounded
by
cannibals
He
leaned
forward
animatedly
There
were
cannibals
to
the
right
of
me
cannibals
to
the
left
of
me
The
light
of
their
torches
flickered
through
the
dense
undergrowth
I
could
hear
their
infernal
chanting
Oom
alla
boom
Oom
alla
boom
Over
and
over
until
I
thought
the
infernal
din
should
surely
drive
me
mad
Suddenly
I
He
broke
off
looking
at
Ernie
oddly
I
say
my
good
man
why
ever
are
you
carrying
that
coffee
maker
Ernie
fidgeted
uncomfortably
It
s
not
a
coffee
maker
it
s
a
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
A
WOT
the
lord
was
amazed
A
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
Ernie
repeated
Lord
Foofaraw
looked
at
him
skeptically
Ernie
looked
again
at
the
device
he
was
carrying
He
sighed
On
the
other
hand
it
could
be
a
coffee
maker
too
I
suppose
Ernie
admitted
Anyway
it
s
genuine
Bakelite
Ah
yes
Bakelite
the
lord
seemed
to
consider
this
answer
reasonable
A
faraway
look
came
into
his
eyes
That
reminds
me
of
the
time
I
was
trekking
through
the
desert
of
Duzzlebuggy
But
what
about
the
cannibals
the
Fly
broke
in
his
antennae
waving
excitedly
Don
t
interrupt
His
Lordship
snapped
Sterno
Lord
Foofaraw
looked
confused
I
say
old
man
there
are
no
cannibals
in
the
deserts
of
Duzzlebuggy
The
Fly
s
antennae
drooped
disappointedly
I
wanted
to
hear
about
the
cannibals
Oh
dear
The
lord
seemed
quite
flustered
by
all
these
interruptions
Where
was
I
Ah
yes
there
I
was
scaling
the
mountains
of
Muffiedump
Ernie
s
mind
wandered
He
noticed
a
beautiful
silver
bell
sitting
on
an
end
table
next
to
him
It
seemed
to
be
a
very
unusual
design
It
was
covered
with
dozens
of
tiny
pushbuttons
each
with
an
odd
little
symbol
next
to
it
Ernie
picked
it
up
curiously
BONG
BONG
Loud
synthesized
bell
sounds
appeared
as
though
out
of
nowhere
Lord
Foofaraw
looked
up
in
annoyance
stopping
his
story
in
mid
sentence
I
say
my
good
man
Whatever
ARE
you
doing
Ernie
looked
up
disconcertedly
I
um
it
The
bell
continued
to
bong
loudly
How
RUDE
Sterno
glared
at
Ernie
Ernie
examined
the
bell
frantically
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
turn
it
off
He
could
see
now
that
is
wasn
t
a
real
bell
but
rather
an
electronic
synthesized
bell
with
orchestral
sounds
a
rhythm
machine
and
full
MIDI
capability
Ernie
pushed
the
tiny
buttons
frenziedly
desperately
trying
to
turn
the
thing
off
The
sound
changed
Chick
a
Boom
Chick
a
BOOM
Ernie
had
accidentally
turned
on
the
rhythm
machine
The
door
to
the
study
opened
The
Butler
entered
a
swarthy
character
who
looked
somehow
familiar
to
Ernie
The
sound
abruptly
stopped
Ernie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
The
Butler
looked
at
Ernie
and
then
at
Lord
Foofaraw
Chu
rang
he
enquired
Ah
yes
Lord
Foofaraw
seemed
to
have
regained
his
composure
More
tea
Richard
Chure
the
Butler
said
agreeably
and
began
refilling
their
cups
His
Lordship
resumed
his
story
and
there
I
was
surrounded
by
techno
savages
They
had
decided
to
sacrifice
a
virgin
but
the
first
one
they
selected
was
discovered
to
be
how
shall
I
say
damaged
so
they
were
obliged
to
move
on
to
the
next
who
became
Virgin
But
she
was
found
to
be
not
entirely
suitable
so
they
settled
upon
Virgin
revised
It
seemed
to
have
gotten
dark
outside
although
they
had
hardly
noticed
it
since
the
Butler
or
someone
had
turned
on
the
lights
That
was
odd
Ernie
thought
because
it
had
been
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
only
a
few
minutes
ago
He
was
going
to
consider
it
further
when
abruptly
the
lights
went
out
plunging
them
all
into
total
darkness
From
out
of
nowhere
a
gust
of
wind
blew
up
throwing
the
French
doors
open
violently
Suddenly
a
shot
rang
out
They
heard
a
cry
and
a
body
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
The
lights
came
on
again
There
in
the
middle
of
the
Persian
carpet
Lord
Foofaraw
lay
dead
in
a
pool
of
blood
Nearby
lay
a
smoking
gun
Ernie
was
stunned
Before
he
could
even
think
of
what
to
do
the
oak
doors
leading
to
the
rest
of
the
house
flew
open
and
a
man
in
