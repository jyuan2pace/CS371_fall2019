game
right
His
antennae
waved
excitedly
It
s
Find
the
Paranoid
right
He
began
bouncing
up
and
down
in
his
seat
I
know
I
know
He
waved
his
hands
in
the
air
excitedly
making
incomprehensible
gestures
First
syllable
sounds
like
SHTOP
DIS
the
psychiatrist
screamed
angrily
From
out
of
nowhere
a
riding
crop
had
appeared
in
his
hand
He
was
about
to
lash
out
at
the
patient
nearest
him
when
he
noticed
that
everyone
was
looking
at
him
He
stopped
and
laughed
weakly
He
quickly
tossed
the
riding
crop
under
a
chair
and
tried
to
regain
his
composure
Zo
uh
where
vere
ve
Ernie
s
eyes
narrowed
accusingly
You
had
a
riding
crop
The
Fly
bounced
up
and
down
excitedly
Oh
wow
He
had
a
riding
crop
He
s
not
supposed
to
have
that
He
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
the
psychiatrist
Personal
foul
Lose
yards
Do
not
pass
Go
do
NOT
collect
He
folded
his
arms
triumphantly
The
doctor
smiled
weakly
Uh
I
can
explain
I
bid
twenty
the
Fly
interrupted
Three
strikes
and
you
re
out
Ernie
noticed
a
framed
diploma
hanging
on
the
wall
behind
him
He
turned
to
read
it
He
looked
at
the
diploma
and
then
at
the
doctor
and
then
at
the
diploma
again
Hey
guys
he
called
out
to
the
others
excitedly
Do
you
know
who
this
doctor
is
He
s
Dr
Heinz
von
Lie
ENOUGH
The
psychiatrist
slammed
a
riding
crop
against
the
seat
of
an
empty
chair
commanding
everyone
s
attention
Ernie
that
the
first
riding
crop
was
still
under
an
empty
chair
where
the
doctor
had
thrown
it
He
appeared
to
have
an
endless
supply
of
them
All
right
He
took
off
the
thin
pince
nez
glasses
he
had
been
wearing
tossed
them
aside
and
replaced
them
with
a
monocle
Zo
you
haff
discovered
my
true
identity
eh
He
laughed
evilly
Ernie
was
pretty
sure
that
the
doctor
really
was
laughing
evilly
that
he
wasn
t
just
imagining
it
It
does
not
matter
von
Liederkranz
continued
The
interrogation
will
proceed
The
Fly
was
confused
Interrogation
I
thought
it
was
therapy
Interrogation
therapy
what
difference
does
it
make
the
Nazi
answered
It
s
all
ze
same
thing
Ernie
pointed
indignantly
at
Sterno
See
And
you
thought
I
was
paranoid
You
were
wrong
I
was
not
Sterno
declared
defensively
I
still
think
you
re
paranoid
But
Ernie
was
totally
taken
aback
Just
because
he
s
really
a
Nazi
doesn
t
mean
you
re
not
paranoid
Sterno
continued
self
importantly
Even
paranoids
have
enemies
Ernie
could
only
sputter
with
indignation
The
Fly
looked
at
the
Nazi
accusingly
You
said
you
were
a
psychiatrist
We
trusted
you
Ach
but
I
am
Huh
The
Fly
was
confused
The
Nazi
explained
I
told
you
I
am
Sturmbannfuhrer
Doktor
Heinz
von
Liederkranz
Und
vot
kind
of
doctor
did
you
tink
I
vas
Sterno
puffed
thoughtfully
on
his
cigar
That
DOES
make
sense
he
admitted
After
all
if
a
Nazi
torturer
were
going
to
be
a
doctor
then
a
psychiatrist
would
be
the
one
to
be
Precisely
von
Liederkranz
agreed
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
agitatedly
You
re
not
going
to
torture
us
are
you
Oh
no
laughed
von
Liederkranz
Ve
don
t
do
dat
anymore
Dat
s
barbaric
The
Fly
sighed
with
relief
Now
ve
have
psychiatry
the
Nazi
smiled
evilly
It
s
MUCH
worse
Ernie
began
edging
slowly
towards
the
door
Don
t
bother
the
psychiatrist
called
out
It
s
locked
Ernie
lunged
for
the
door
anyway
No
one
made
a
move
to
stop
him
The
door
was
solid
steel
and
securely
locked
Ernie
glumly
returned
to
his
seat
Von
Liederkranz
turned
to
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
hadn
t
been
paying
much
attention
to
the
proceedings
He
was
still
engrossed
in
the
TV
Guide
He
appeared
to
be
diligently
searching
for
something
to
watch
other
than
Reptile
shows
The
Nazi
smiled
malevolently
Zo
you
didn
t
like
ze
Hot
Vhirling
Corkscrew
eh
Captain
Memory
looked
up
annoyedly
Not
THAT
again
Von
Liederkranz
laughed
diabolically
Oh
no
of
COURSE
not
Ve
have
something
heh
heh
MUCH
vorse
He
peered
closely
at
the
Captain
Your
mother
never
liked
you
he
announced
Captain
Memory
s
eyes
went
wide
with
shock
Aaugghh
he
screamed
burying
his
head
in
his
arms
The
Nazi
chuckled
sadistically
I
told
you
psychiatry
is
MUCH
vorse
Und
much
more
effective
Ernie
noticed
that
the
Nazi
had
discarded
his
cigar
and
was
now
holding
a
cigarette
in
a
long
holder
Now
vill
you
tell
us
how
you
gain
access
to
the
system
Poor
Captain
Memory
could
only
whimper
Von
Liederkranz
didn
t
seem
to
mind
that
the
Captain
refused
to
talk
It
gave
him
more
opportunity
to
practice
his
sadistic
psychiatry
Very
vell
he
smirked
You
asked
for
it
He
peered
intently
at
the
Captain
choosing
his
words
carefully
You
re
totally
inadequate
NO
screamed
Captain
Memory
curling
himself
up
into
a
tight
ball
Heh
heh
the
Nazi
chuckled
He
looked
closely
at
Captain
Memory
preparing
his
next
shot
You
re
The
Captain
couldn
t
take
any
more
Uh
C
D
C
he
cried
Suddenly
the
scene
vanished
Ernie
staggered
with
vertigo
and
sat
down
heavily
on
the
ground
His
eyes
stung
as
a
gust
of
wind
blew
sand
in
his
face
His
