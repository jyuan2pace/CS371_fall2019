thing
right
Sterno
regarded
Ernie
critically
Why
are
you
still
carrying
that
ridiculous
plastic
broadsword
Ernie
shifted
uncomfortably
Hey
I
told
you
it
s
a
forty
buck
deposit
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
Hopeless
Ernie
sat
down
in
a
comfortable
looking
chair
He
thought
he
had
better
take
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
rest
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
how
long
all
of
this
craziness
was
going
to
continue
So
like
what
s
with
that
Lucy
chick
the
Fly
asked
Captain
Memory
I
mean
like
what
s
her
problem
Oh
she
s
an
alien
explained
the
Captain
A
what
You
know
the
Captain
went
on
Come
from
outer
space
invade
the
Earth
steal
your
brain
that
kinda
stuff
The
Captain
made
himself
comfortable
on
a
small
sofa
and
began
leafing
through
his
copy
of
the
TV
Guide
Aliens
Ernie
asked
confusedly
Are
they
really
aliens
There
as
real
as
anything
in
Cyberspace
I
suppose
the
Captain
commented
But
what
are
they
DOING
here
Ernie
wanted
to
know
They
re
part
of
a
game
called
MENACE
FROM
PLANET
ZERO
It
s
quite
popular
the
Captain
explained
I
figured
we
d
run
across
it
sooner
or
later
With
all
the
systems
Waldo
s
been
taking
over
the
odds
are
that
it
d
be
in
at
least
one
of
them
The
Fly
seemed
a
bit
skeptical
Well
gee
that
chick
sure
didn
t
look
like
an
alien
The
Captain
was
impatient
She
s
in
disguise
of
course
You
wouldn
t
want
to
see
what
she
really
looks
like
He
shuddered
Anyway
he
continued
That
whole
bunch
are
aliens
in
disguise
They
ve
been
watching
our
s
TV
shows
and
they
think
those
TV
characters
are
normal
Earth
people
They
think
if
they
disguise
themselves
as
s
TV
characters
you
Earth
people
will
never
know
the
difference
They
don
t
seem
to
be
very
smart
Ernie
commented
Well
you
know
said
the
Captain
thoughtfully
Intelligence
is
not
the
only
way
to
approach
reality
There
are
other
ways
of
thinking
It
s
possible
to
approach
problem
solving
from
an
entirely
different
perspective
There
are
civilizations
in
which
thinking
is
done
in
an
entirely
different
way
where
intelligence
is
replaced
by
a
whole
different
way
of
looking
at
the
universe
Ernie
had
never
heard
Captain
Memory
get
so
philosophical
before
So
do
these
aliens
have
a
completely
different
way
of
thinking
he
asked
wonderingly
No
said
the
Captain
reflectively
They
re
just
stupid
He
returned
to
his
TV
Guide
I
mighta
known
said
the
Fly
reflectively
After
all
she
s
hanging
out
with
that
Ricky
guy
Man
he
s
something
else
Anybody
who
d
wear
a
shirt
like
that
He
trailed
off
looking
sideways
at
Ernie
A
number
of
magazines
were
scattered
about
an
end
table
next
to
Ernie
s
chair
A
headline
in
one
of
the
caught
Ernie
s
eye
FANTASTIC
ARCHAEOLOGICAL
FIND
REVEALED
Ernie
picked
it
up
and
began
to
read
On
October
an
Arab
shepherd
following
a
stray
animal
into
a
cave
near
the
Sea
of
Galilee
made
an
incredible
find
a
find
unparalleled
in
modern
history
A
find
so
monumental
so
earth
shattering
so
threatening
to
world
governments
and
religious
institutions
that
its
very
existence
has
been
suppressed
Only
now
by
means
of
smuggled
documents
obtained
at
great
personal
risk
to
all
involved
can
this
fabulous
story
come
to
light
the
story
of
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Ernie
was
intrigued
He
read
on
Our
story
must
really
begin
in
Ancient
Egypt
deep
in
the
mysteries
of
the
Middle
Kingdom
an
age
which
produced
some
of
the
greatest
wonders
the
world
has
even
seen
Some
of
these
like
the
Pyramids
have
been
known
to
the
world
for
millennia
Yet
it
stands
to
reason
that
any
people
capable
of
producing
wonders
like
these
wonders
which
the
modern
world
has
yet
to
equal
must
also
have
been
capable
of
producing
many
other
amazing
things
on
a
smaller
scale
Yet
all
of
these
have
been
lost
in
the
sands
of
time
or
have
they
Let
us
consider
for
a
moment
the
phonograph
a
relatively
simple
device
invented
in
the
last
century
by
Thomas
Edison
In
its
basic
form
it
consists
of
a
disc
or
even
a
cylinder
driven
by
a
crank
that
comes
in
contact
with
a
needle
attached
to
a
cone
One
can
then
either
play
or
record
simply
by
turning
the
crank
and
either
speaking
into
the
cone
or
listening
That
s
all
there
is
to
it
A
simple
device
like
this
can
be
made
with
almost
anyone
with
basic
tools
It
could
have
been
made
thousands
of
years
ago
it
could
even
have
been
made
by
the
ancient
Egyptians
Certainly
any
civilization
capable
of
producing
incredible
engineering
feats
like
the
Pyramids
would
be
capable
of
constructing
a
simple
mechanical
device
like
this
Now
there
is
evidence
that
they
did
In
the
tomb
of
the
Pharaoh
Pepto
II
at
Bismol
hieroglyphics
have
been
found
which
bear
an
uncanny
resemblance
to
Edison
s
early
phonographs
Along
with
these
were
others
which
were
translated
to
read
and
the
voice
of
the
Pharaoh
shall
speak
on
after
he
is
gone
and
fragment
missing
that
we
who
are
as
dogs
to
the
mighty
Pharaoh
shall
listen
to
Our
Master
s
Voice
Ernie
