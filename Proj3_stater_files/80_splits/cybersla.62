What
the
detective
snapped
He
laughed
nervously
Oh
Right
BRITISH
detective
He
laughed
again
Pip
pip
Cheerio
Eh
wot
Ernie
frowned
There
was
something
very
suspicious
about
this
detective
For
one
thing
his
large
British
style
handlebar
mustache
did
not
seem
to
be
attached
to
his
face
very
well
It
was
slowly
drooping
off
one
side
of
his
face
There
was
something
funny
about
his
clothes
too
The
trenchcoat
was
okay
the
hat
was
okay
Maybe
it
was
the
jackboots
Sterno
gave
the
detective
a
pitiless
glare
You
lost
your
character
he
accused
The
detective
laughed
nervously
Character
Vot
character
I
m
not
a
character
I
m
uh
He
looked
flustered
He
elbowed
the
bobby
next
to
him
Quick
he
whispered
Who
am
I
The
bobby
whispered
something
in
his
ear
The
detective
seemed
to
recover
his
composure
somewhat
Oh
yes
Of
course
I
m
the
famous
British
detective
Thomas
Cheddar
Sterno
s
fur
stood
on
end
Oh
no
It
s
cheese
CHEESE
RUN
he
wailed
But
it
was
too
late
The
detective
whipped
an
evil
looking
weapon
out
from
under
his
raincoat
which
parted
to
reveal
a
black
SS
uniform
beneath
it
Enough
of
zis
shtupidity
he
cried
holding
the
foursome
at
bay
You
vill
perhaps
recognize
me
now
he
said
confidently
He
screwed
a
monocle
into
one
eye
and
whipped
off
the
false
handlebar
mustache
with
a
flourish
He
immediately
regretted
this
and
winced
with
pain
as
the
glue
on
the
false
mustache
tore
out
half
the
hairs
of
his
real
mustache
He
quickly
regained
his
composure
however
and
waited
for
some
response
from
the
foursome
Captain
Memory
looked
at
Ernie
Ernie
shrugged
The
detective
looked
from
one
to
the
other
You
DO
recognize
me
ja
he
asked
a
bit
uncertainly
I
m
sure
we
ve
seen
you
someplace
before
said
Sterno
patronizingly
Of
course
agreed
Captain
Memory
It
s
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
It
s
uh
He
trailed
off
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
uncertainly
Suddenly
he
brightened
Oh
I
get
it
It
s
a
game
right
First
syllable
Sounds
like
He
began
gesticulating
wildly
I
know
I
know
It
s
Fred
Astaire
right
Fred
Astaire
Enough
the
detective
shouted
angrily
I
cannot
believe
dat
you
do
not
recognize
me
Sturmbannfuhrer
Dr

Vell

smiled
evilly

Sterno
continued
It

Von

dropped
out
of
his
eye
Was

We

He
smiled
evilly
Okay
said
Captain

agreeably
Why

Nein

von

shrieked
I

The
Fly
sulked
Why
do
you
always
get
to
ask
the
questions
How
come
we
never
get
to
ask
any
questions
Quite
right
Sterno
asserted
And
why
must
you
always
wear
that
dreadful
uniform
Von
Liederkranz
stopped
startled
Uniform
Vot
s
wrong
vis
my
uniform
I

really
Sterno
sniffed
It
s
hardly
the
thing
for
High
Tea
is
it
I
should
think
a
top
hat
Puttink

a
top
hat
von
Liederkranz
asked
incredulously
White

Sterno
went
on
Puttink
on
a
white
tie
The
Nazi
seemed
amazed
PUTTING
ON
THE
RITZ
The
Fly
shouted
joyously
finishing
the
line
of
the
song
I
knew
it
I
knew
it
was
Fred
Astaire
Von
Liederkranz
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
Ja
I
DO
look
a
great
deal
like
your
Fred
Astaire
nein
Of
course
he
didn
t
look
anything
like
Fred
Astaire
but
no
one
wanted
to
be
the
one
to
tell
him
that
Oh
yes
Sterno
enthused
insincerely
You
ve
all
the
elegance
all
the
grace
of
the
greatest
dancer
of
all
time
Von
Liederkranz
preened
Ja
dat
s
right
I
do
Looking
down
he
noticed
Lord
Foofaraw
s
top
hat
which
had
rolled
off
his
head
when
he
collapsed
dead
He
picked
it
up
tossing
his
own
military
cap
aside
Using
Lord
Foofaraw
s
top
hat
and
his
own
riding
crop
as
a
cane
he
attempted
to
do
a
Fred
Astaire
style
top
hat
and
cane
number
He
began
to
do
a
few
awkward
shuffling
dance
steps
Puttink
on
mein
top
hat
he
began
to
sing
The
Bobbies
had
by
now
shed
their
English
policeman
uniforms
to
reveal
their
Nazi
uniforms
beneath
They
were
totally
confused
by
this
turn
of
events
They
shuffled
about
awkwardly
not
knowing
what
to
do
Von
Liederkranz
glared
at
them
Sing
he
commanded
The
Nazi
s
lined
up
and
formed
a
chorus
line
swaying
with
the
music
singing
off
key
puttink
on
mein
white
tie
Von
Liederkranz
attempted
to
do
some
slightly
more
complicated
steps
but
succeeded
only
in
knocking
over
the
silver
tray
sending
the
tea
cups
and
little
plastic
sandwiches
crashing
to
the
ground
This
threw
the
other
Nazi
s
off
their
rhythm
Half
of
them
swayed
left
and
half
swayed
right
causing
them
to
violently
bump
into
each
other
knocking
some
off
their
feet
Their
voices
trailed
