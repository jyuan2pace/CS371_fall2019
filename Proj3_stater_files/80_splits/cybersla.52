face
That
cracks
me
up
The
laughter
was
contagious
all
the
soldiers
were
doubled
up
with
laughter
too
Hey
Gumby
Attila
chortled
What
are
you
gonna
do
with
that
plastic
broadsword
You
gonna
loot
pillage
and
rape
Well
uh
Ernie
stammered
I
m
uh
not
exactly
sure
how
to
do
that
Besides
uh
don
t
you
need
a
license
for
that
or
something
Attila
broke
up
again
License
to
loot
I
love
it
These
guys
are
hysterical
Sterno
was
getting
annoyed
This
IS
getting
a
bit
tedious
he
complained
Attila
s
jaw
dropped
Wow
A
talking
dog
What
a
great
act
I
get
it
now
you
guys
are
traveling
clowns
right
You
re
part
of
a
circus
right
Captain
Memory
looked
perturbed
He
seemed
to
be
sensitive
about
being
called
a
clown
Is
that
an
insult
Attila
collapsed
in
laughter
again
Is
that
an
insult
he
says
and
he
says
it
with
a
straight
face
You
guys
really
crack
me
up
The
foursome
shifted
about
uncomfortably
while
Attila
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
laughing
uncontrollably
After
what
seemed
to
be
a
very
long
time
Attila
looked
up
tears
of
laughter
still
streaming
down
his
face
Say
you
guys
are
just
great
We
ve
been
doing
so
much
raping
looting
and
pillaging
that
it
s
just
not
that
much
fun
anymore
What
I
really
need
these
days
is
a
good
laugh
I
feel
a
lot
better
now
He
thought
a
moment
I
think
I
ll
give
you
guys
a
reward
He
turned
to
Ernie
How
about
a
bag
of
gold
Would
you
like
that
Ernie
considered
that
Yeah
I
guess
that
would
be
nice
I
owe
kind
of
a
lot
of
money
right
now
and
I
ve
been
having
a
lot
of
problem
with
bill
collectors
Attila
chuckled
Yeah
I
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
bill
collectors
too
But
I
solved
that
problem
Wanna
know
how
Yeah
Ernie
was
excited
Maybe
he
could
use
this
solution
for
his
bill
paying
problems
Attila
chuckled
I
chopped
their
heads
off
You
should
have
seen
their
faces
He
thought
a
moment
In
fact
I
think
I
still
have
them
around
here
somewhere
Wanna
see
em
Ernie
grimaced
No
that
s
okay
I
m
not
supposed
to
look
at
severed
heads
It
makes
my
stomach
hurt
At
this
Attila
collapsed
into
helpless
laughter
again
You
guys
are
just
a
laugh
a
minute
Just
when
I
think
I
ve
heard
it
all
you
come
up
with
another
one
Ernie
frowned
None
of
this
seemed
very
funny
to
him
at
all
You
Huns
really
have
a
strange
sense
of
humor
Attila
s
brow
furled
We
do
huh
he
said
menacingly
Sterno
and
the
Fly
turned
to
look
at
Ernie
Ernie
shuffled
uncomfortably
It
occurred
to
him
that
maybe
he
shouldn
t
have
said
that
A
broad
grin
appeared
across
Attila
s
face
That
s
funny
I
like
it
Ernie
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
Suddenly
a
messenger
ran
up
to
the
King
of
the
Huns
Your
magnificence
we
found
these
strangers
lurking
around
the
edge
of
the
camp
Ernie
looked
behind
him
Hun
soldiers
were
dragging
forth
three
struggling
captives
The
first
was
someone
Ernie
did
not
recognize
a
beefy
man
in
an
ill
fitting
suit
The
other
two
were
Lucy
and
Desi
Oh
Vito
Lucy
said
to
the
beefy
man
Make
them
let
us
go
Oh
my
gosh
said
Ernie
involuntarily
Attila
looked
at
Ernie
sternly
Do
you
know
these
people
Uh
sort
of
Ernie
admitted
They
re
uh
bill
collectors
Attila
s
face
lit
up
Bill
collectors
My
favorite
Oh
what
fun
Let
s
see
he
paused
reflectively
Shall
we
boil
them
in
oil
or
flay
them
alive
Maybe
we
could
boil
them
until
they
re
tender
and
then
flay
them
Or
maybe
He
strode
off
to
examine
his
new
captives
leaving
Ernie
and
the
other
alone
Looks
like
you
ve
solved
the
bill
collector
problem
Sterno
said
to
Ernie
Uh
yeah
I
guess
so
decided
Ernie
So
why
don
t
we
get
out
of
here
before
Attila
decides
to
do
something
like
that
to
us
too
Oh
he
wouldn
t
do
that
the
Fly
said
Attila
likes
us
Ernie
watched
as
Attila
fingered
Lucy
s
red
curls
Lucy
bit
him
Attila
drew
his
sword
Ernie
decided
he
didn
t
want
to
watch
what
came
next
Just
the
same
let
s
go
okay
What
s
the
matter
said
Sterno
tauntingly
Don
t
you
want
to
see
what
Attila
s
going
to
do
to
them
Uh
I
d
just
as
soon
not
all
right
Let
s
just
go
okay
Sterno
continued
to
look
back
Looks
like
Lucy
s
losing
her
head
over
Attila
he
said
smirking
Ernie
s
stomach
turned
over
again
He
hadn
t
really
felt
very
good
ever
since
eating
that
remote
control
unit
he
was
sure
he
didn
t
want
to
see
anything
that
might
make
him
feel
worse
Attila
strode
back
to
his
throne
his
huge
broadsword
dripping
bright
red
blood
Gee
that
was
fun
He
sighed
Well
I
guess
I
gotta
get
back
to
business
Who
am
I
supposed
to
see
next
Three
representatives
of
the
King
of
the
Parthians
your
majesty
an
attendant
told
him
Oh
yeah
What
are
their
names
Larry
Moe
and
Curly
