Wouldn
t
you
know
she
s
married
He
was
obviously
deeply
disappointed
He
brightened
a
bit
Say
he
said
to
Lucy
You
wouldn
t
happen
to
have
any
girlfriends
you
could
ask
over
do
you
Friends
said
Lucy
shrilly
Sure
I
got
friends
In
fact
a
couple
of
them
are
on
there
way
over
right
now
The
Fly
was
thrilled
Oh
boy
oh
boy
His
antennae
waved
excitedly
He
turned
to
Ricky
Hey
I
like
the
shirt
guy
It
s
the
new
in
thing
right
Chure
Ricky
agreed
Ees
de
latest
style
in
Habana
The
door
opened
and
in
walked
an
older
couple
also
dressed
in
s
styles
Oh
said
Lucy
Here
s
my
friends
now
Fellas
this
is
Fred
and
Ethel
Mertz
Aww
The
Fly
was
disappointed
These
weren
t
the
type
of
friends
he
had
been
hoping
for
Sterno
leaned
forward
There
is
something
terribly
wrong
with
these
people
he
said
to
Ernie
and
the
Captain
I
can
smell
it
Leave
me
alone
said
Ernie
He
hadn
t
forgiven
Sterno
for
blaming
the
bank
problem
on
him
All
these
people
looked
terribly
familiar
to
Ernie
Suddenly
he
had
it
I
ve
got
it
he
shouted
The
Fly
was
more
mystified
than
ever
Now
HE
S
got
it
What
is
it
contagious
He
edged
away
from
Ernie
slightly
No
not
THAT
said
Ernie
impatiently
I
just
remembered
it
s
I
Love
Lucy
Lucy
put
her
hand
on
Ernie
s
arm
I
love
you
too
She
said
She
edged
closer
Now
that
we
re
friends
I
d
like
to
ask
you
a
little
favor
What
asked
Ernie
suspiciously
It
s
just
a
little
thing
she
began
hesitantly
What
He
edged
away
uncomfortably
We
d
just
like
to
borrow
it
just
for
a
little
while
We
ll
bring
it
right
back
What
Ernie
was
getting
impatient
Um
Lucy
seemed
a
bit
embarrassed
We
d
like
to
borrow
your
brain
MY
BRAIN
shrieked
Ernie
We
just
want
to
borrow
it
said
Lucy
quickly
Just
for
a
little
while
We
re
not
going
to
steal
it
Lucy
laughed
nervously
NO
Ernie
cried
Really
you
don
t
have
anything
to
worry
about
Lucy
continued
We
re
not
going
to
take
it
back
to
our
home
planet
or
anything
And
we
re
certainly
not
going
to
put
it
into
a
giant
killer
robot
and
use
it
to
take
over
the
Earth
She
laughed
We
would
never
do
that
She
turned
to
Ricky
and
the
Mertz
s
Would
we
Oh
no
they
all
laughed
We
d
never
do
that
Never
There
that
proves
it
Lucy
concluded
So
how
about
it
She
reached
towards
Ernie
s
head
NO
Ernie
screamed
leaping
off
the
bar
stool
Keep
your
hands
off
my
brain
He
whipped
out
his
plastic
broadsword
and
brandished
it
menacingly
After
standing
there
a
few
moments
Ernie
became
aware
of
everyone
looking
at
him
very
peculiarly
Hey
guy
the
Fly
inquired
Like
what
are
you
gonna
do
with
that
plastic
sword
Ernie
could
hear
the
sound
of
muffled
laughter
but
he
couldn
t
tell
where
it
was
coming
from
Ernie
glowered
Okay
okay
he
said
replacing
the
sword
in
it
s
sheath
Just
keep
your
hands
off
my
brain
all
right
Lucy
frowned
She
looked
at
Sterno
and
then
looked
at
her
companions
Dog
brain
she
asked
them
They
all
shook
their
heads
no
She
looked
at
the
Fly
Fly
brain
she
asked
Ricky
and
the
Mertz
s
Nope
They
shook
their
heads
She
looked
at
Captain
Memory
She
smiled
broadly
I
wonder
if
I
could
ask
you
a
favor
she
began
No
chance
Captain
Memory
cut
her
off
Her
expression
became
ugly
Extremely
ugly
In
fact
thought
Ernie
she
was
changing
into
just
about
the
ugliest
thing
Ernie
had
ever
seen
Lucy
snarled
revealing
rows
of
pointed
reptilian
looking
teeth
and
a
forked
tongue
Foolish
Earth
creatures
she
hissed
pulling
out
a
frightening
looking
weapon
You
will
turn
your
brains
over
to
us
or
we
will
destroy
this
miserable
planet
of
yours
Who
ARE
these
people
Ernie
whispered
to
Captain
Memory
Remember
I
told
you
about
those
aliens
Captain
Memory
asked
Ernie
nodded
Well
here
they
are
Hey
guys
what
do
we
do
now
the
Fly
asked
Ernie
and
Captain
Memory
looking
at
Lucy
s
weapon
uneasily
Captain
Memory
looked
up
brightly
Hey
he
said
to
Lucy
and
her
companions
Wanna
watch
some
TV
Lucy
and
the
other
aliens
were
totally
confused
Watch
TV
I
don
t
remember
that
Is
that
in
the
script
What
are
we
supposed
to
do
They
looked
at
each
other
confusedly
Oh
wow
look
what
s
on
Before
anyone
could
stop
him
Captain
Memory
had
reached
behind
the
bar
and
turned
on
the
TV
It
s
time
for
Wheel
of
Torture

Ernie
blinked
and
staggered
Once
again
he
suddenly
found
himself
on
the
game

stage
His
stomach

again
He
