t
pay
up
Well
Ernie
tried
again
Look
Vito
broke
in
I
m
comin
to
get
da
money
punk
and
you
better
have
it
OR
ELSE
He
hung
up
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Maybe
we
should
go
someplace
else
he
suggested
Okay
said
the
Captain
agreeably
Where
Ernie
concentrated
I
know
he
said
brightly
How
about
we
go
to
the
Middle
East
and
look
for
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Sterno
moaned
Not
THAT
again
The
Captain
looked
doubtful
It
s
kind
of
a
long
walk
Ernie
frowned
Can
t
you
just
transport
us
there
Well
you
know
I
don
t
really
like
to
do
that
too
often
answered
the
Captain
There
s
always
a
certain
amount
of
risk
With
these
locations
changing
all
the
time
there
s
always
a
chance
of
a
FATAL
ERROR
creeping
in
and
Okay
okay
said
Ernie
quickly
Forget
I
said
it
okay
Have
it
your
way
said
the
Captain
agreeably
Ernie
sighed
All
of
this
was
just
too
much
for
him
If
only
we
had
some
kind
of
vehicle
or
something
A
spaceship
or
even
a
car
Captain
Memory
looked
thoughtful
Oh
you
want
a
spaceship
You
have
a
SPACESHIP
Ernie
cried
Well
it
s
just
a
little
something
I
take
out
on
the
weekends
the
Captain
explained
modestly
It
s
no
big
deal
I
mean
it
doesn
t
have
a
kitchen
or
a
porta
john
or
anything
It
s
just
for
short
hops
like
around
the
solar
system
or
something
It
s
called
the
Luna
C
Lunacy
Sterno
inquired
Oh
no
Captain
Memory
laughed
The
Luna
C
Why
C
Ernie
was
curious
Well
you
know
after
the
Luna
A
and
the
Luna
B
there
s
the
Luna
C
Captain
Memory
explained
So
what
happened
to
the
Luna
A
and
the
Luna
B
Sterno
wanted
to
know
Captain
Memory
suddenly
became
very
quiet
After
a
few
moments
he
muttered
Well
well
it
wasn
t
my
fault
Ernie
frowned
What
wasn
t
It
was
a
stupid
place
to
put
a
planet
anyway
Captain
Memory
went
on
suddenly
indignant
I
mean
how
was
I
supposed
to
know
there
was
a
planet
in
that
sector
Nobody
would
ve
expected
a
planet
to
be
in
that
sector
A
planet
Ernie
asked
incredulously
Well
okay
okay
Captain
Memory
continued
defensively
Maybe
I
was
a
little
way
out
of
the
spacelane
It
could
happen
to
anybody
A
couple
of
light
years
this
way
or
that
A
couple
of
light
years
Sterno
inquired
Okay
okay
Captain
Memory
seemed
very
ill
at
ease
So
maybe
I
had
a
couple
of
drinks
Big
deal
I
mean
I
was
at
a
party
right
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
just
stand
around
all
night
Okay
so
maybe
I
shouldn
t
have
been
doing
Warp
in
a
Warp
zone
So
I
made
a
little
mistake
Big
deal
I
mean
what
am
I
supposed
to
do
pay
for
this
the
rest
of
my
life
or
what
Let
me
get
this
straight
Sterno
said
You
hit
a
planet
at
Warp
It
was
a
stupid
place
to
put
a
planet
Captain
Memory
repeated
petulantly
It
should
ve
had
a
guard
rail
or
something
So
what
happened
Ernie
asked
incredulously
Oh
Captain
Memory
looked
at
the
ground
I
hadda
pay
for
it
You
had
to
pay
for
a
PLANET
Well
I
had
insurance
the
Captain
said
brightly
Um
that
is
I
had
insurance
He
trailed
off
Sterno
caught
the
drift
You
don
t
have
insurance
any
more
Captain
Memory
looked
very
uncomfortable
Well
my
premiums
kind
of
went
up
Sterno
thought
for
a
moment
You
said
there
was
a
Luna
A
and
a
Luna
B
That
accounts
for
one
of
them
What
happened
to
the
other
one
Captain
Memory
fidgeted
Can
t
we
talk
about
something
else
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
So
are
you
going
to
be
flying
this
spaceship
Well
uh
no
the
Captain
began
Thank
Heavens
Sterno
broke
in
I
would
I
mean
I
could
Captain
Memory
continued
Just
as
soon
as
I
get
my
license
back
Sterno
sighed
So
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
wait
No
no
the
Captain
said
reassuringly
They
gave
me
a
pilot
Sterno
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
So
where
is
this
spaceship
Ernie
asked
excitedly
He
was
really
looking
forward
to
the
prospect
of
seeing
a
real
live
spaceship
I
left
it
parked
up
in
orbit
the
Captain
explained
Want
me
to
call
it
down
SURE
Okay
The
Captain
began
looking
around
Where
s
my
remote
control
I
had
it
here
a
minute
ago
Ernie
began
looking
around
as
well
What
does
it
look
like
Oh
it
s
about
so
Captain
Memory
motioned
with
his
hands
to
indicated
a
rectangle
about
six
inches
long
It
s
wrapped
in
white
paper
Ernie
began
to
feel
uneasy
What
color
was
it
Under
the
paper
that
is
The
Captain
was
still
looking
around
It
s
brown
and
kind
of
soft
The
Captain
looked
under
the
sofa
That
s
funny
Here
s
the
paper
from
it
but
it
s
all
crumpled
up
And
the
remote
is
gone
Ernie
began
to
get
a
real
bad
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
Um
was
it
by
any
chance
uh
chocolate
Well
sure
After
all
it
was
either
that
or
