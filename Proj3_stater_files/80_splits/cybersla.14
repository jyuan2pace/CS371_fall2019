him
he
thought
The
more
he
argued
about
all
of
this
the
more
he
seemed
to
be
losing
ground
He
wasn
t
even
sure
what
point
he
was
losing
ground
on
Ernie
decided
to
try
another
approach
Okay
I
give
up
You
tell
me
then
What
is
going
on
Oh
you
want
to
know
what
s
going
on
said
the
Captain
brightly
He
always
enjoyed
telling
stories
Why
didn
t
you
say
so
Well
he
went
on
warming
up
to
his
subject
All
of
this
is
totally
artificial
It
was
put
here
to
be
a
trap
That
s
what
I
was
trying
to
tell
you
cried
Ernie
excitedly
It
s
a
trap
I
knew
it
Captain
Memory
was
annoyed
Do
you
want
to
hear
this
or
do
you
want
to
talk
Sorry
Ernie
shut
up
Where
was
I
Captain
Memory
gathered
his
thoughts
Oh
yes
Anyway
this
is
part
of
a
game
called
THE
FLINTSTONES
in
which
Fred
and
Barney
thwart
an
attempt
by
aliens
to
take
over
the
Earth
back
in
the
Stone
Age
It
s
really
quite
elaborate
An
excellent
game
Sterno
added
I
ve
played
it
myself
Anyway
Captain
Memory
continued
This
house
is
actually
a
trap
set
by
the
aliens
to
try
to
capture
Earth
people
We
knew
that
but
we
thought
we
d
come
in
here
anyway
because
it
s
more
comfortable
than
a
cave
don
t
you
think
Aha
cried
Sterno
What
Ernie
was
startled
Cigars
Sterno
had
found
a
stone
jar
and
opened
it
He
pulled
out
a
cigar
and
examined
it
sniffing
it
carefully
They
re
not
very
good
but
I
suppose
they
ll
have
to
do
One
must
after
all
make
allowances
in
the
Stone
Age
He
lit
one
puffing
little
clouds
of
blue
smoke
into
the
air
Captain
Memory
returned
to
the
TV
Guide
So
what
about
these
aliens
Ernie
inquired
What
do
they
want
Oh
I
don
t
know
Typical
alien
stuff
I
imagine
Take
me
to
your
leader
conquer
the
world
steal
your
brain
You
know
all
that
stuff
aliens
always
do
Ernie
was
mystified
But
why
Oh
I
don
t
know
Probably
from
watching
old
science
fiction
movies
on
TV
The
aliens
seem
to
think
that
sort
of
thing
is
expected
of
them
Ernie
wasn
t
following
this
Watching
TV
Aliens
watch
TV
Of
course
Captain
Memory
went
on
You
d
have
to
expect
something
like
that
to
happen
After
all
we
ve
been
beaming
those
radio
and
television
waves
out
into
outer
space
for
years
It
was
only
a
matter
of
time
until
someone
picked
them
up
Do
you
realize
that
there
are
civilizations
forty
light
years
from
here
that
are
now
watching
s
situation
comedies
What
do
you
suppose
they
think
of
that
Well
Ernie
began
Did
you
ever
think
that
they
might
consider
it
a
hostile
act
Captain
Memory
continued
animatedly
They
might
think
having
I
Love
Lucy
reruns
beamed
at
them
is
an
act
of
war
Huh
Ernie
wasn
t
following
this
too
well
Well
look
at
it
from
their
point
of
view
Captain
Memory
explained
Here
they
are
they
come
home
from
a
hard
day
at
well
whatever
it
is
they
do
they
just
wanna
watch
a
little
TV
you
know
So
they
flip
on
their
set
and
what
do
they
get
Mr
Ed
The
Flintstones
I
Love
Lucy
They
don
t
wanna
watch
this
They
wanna
watch
you
know
ALIEN
shows
Ernie
considered
this
I
Love
Lucy
huh
Well
I
can
see
their
point
So
maybe
they
decide
to
flip
on
the
stereo
Captain
Memory
continued
And
what
do
they
get
The
Chiffons
the
Ronettes
Chuck
Berry
Maybe
they
don
t
like
rock
n
roll
Did
you
ever
think
of
that
No
Ernie
was
amazed
I
thought
everybody
liked
rock
n
roll
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
You
can
t
take
anything
for
granted
in
Outer
Space
Ernie
found
this
disturbing
Maybe
it
wasn
t
such
a
good
idea
to
let
all
those
TV
waves
get
out
into
space
then
Probably
not
agreed
Captain
Memory
But
it
s
too
late
now
We
ll
just
have
to
deal
with
the
consequences
Ernie
didn
t
like
that
word
consequences
He
would
rather
not
think
about
what
the
consequences
of
all
of
this
might
be
He
rubbed
his
head
He
especially
didn
t
like
that
steal
your
brain
business
So
what
are
we
gonna
do
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Do
repeated
Captain
Memory
distantly
He
had
returned
to
reading
Ernie
heard
a
shout
far
in
the
distance
He
strained
his
ears
There
it
was
again
It
sounded
like
Yabba
dabba
doo
Look
I
think
we
ought
to
get
out
of
here
Ernie
pleaded
I
think
something
bad
is
gonna
happen
if
we
don
t
leave
like
right
now
Oh
my
What
a
coincidence
cried
Captain
Memory
What
now
Ernie
asked
uneasily
You
ll
never
guess
what
s
on
And
here
we
were
talking
about
almost
that
very
thing
just
a
moment
ago
Ernie
had
a
bad
feeling
about
this
Not
That
s
right
returned
Captain
Memory
jovially
TRUTH
OR
CONSEQUENCES
I
really
don
t
wanna
watch
But
it
was
too
late
Captain
Memory
had
already
flipped
on
the
set
The
set
came
on
and
here
s
our
host
the
announcer
