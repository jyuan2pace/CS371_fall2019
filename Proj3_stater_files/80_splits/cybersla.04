giving
him
a
terrible
headache
Suddenly
a
thought
occurred
to
him
Hey
this
is
all
really
just
a
game
right
Captain
Memory
looked
annoyed
No
it
is
not
a
game
It
never
was
a
game
Will
you
PLEASE
stop
saying
that
Ernie
moaned
quietly
Captain
Memory
glanced
at
his
wrist
We
d
better
hurry
We
re
running
out
of
time
Ernie
looked
up
You
don
t
have
a
watch
he
said
suspiciously
Captain
Memory
continued
to
look
at
his
bare
wrist
Well
no
he
said
a
bit
crestfallen
I
always
wanted
one
though
Ernie
looked
around
Can
t
we
just
stay
here
It
s
nice
here
They
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
large
living
room
of
a
well
kept
home
It
appeared
to
be
furnished
in
Fabulous
Fifties
style
except
for
a
few
odd
objects
that
Ernie
couldn
t
identify
We
can
t
stay
in
one
place
to
long
replied
Captain
Memory
Waldo
Stadium
is
sorting
his
data
as
fast
as
he
can
If
we
stay
in
one
place
too
long
sooner
or
later
he
ll
zero
in
on
us
Anyway
Captain
Memory
looked
around
This
place
is
beginning
to
look
kind
of
familiar
to
me
If
I
m
right
this
isn
t
a
safe
place
to
be
Okay
then
where
are
we
the
dog
demanded
I
think
we
ve
landed
in
a
game
called
ATTACK
OF
THE
GIANT
EGGPLANT
If
I
m
right
this
place
is
going
to
be
nuked
in
he
glanced
at
his
bare
wrist
again
oh
forty
five
minutes
or
so
Ernie
began
to
be
aware
of
a
queasy
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
This
is
making
me
anxious
he
thought
I
m
not
going
to
do
things
like
this
anymore
That
s
it
no
more
Virtual
Reality
for
me
Maybe
you
d
like
to
watch
some
TV
Captain
Memory
suggested
cheerfully
Maybe
that
would
make
you
feel
better
I
thought
we
were
in
a
hurry
Ernie
answered
We
can
watch
for
a
couple
minutes
the
Captain
replied
I
guess
that
makes
as
much
sense
as
anything
else
Ernie
thought
and
followed
the
Captain
towards
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
he
noticed
a
television
with
a
ten
foot
wide
screen
playing
with
the
sound
turned
off
As
they
approached
the
television
Ernie
noticed
a
large
high
backed
s
style
sofa
positioned
close
in
front
of
the
TV
As
they
came
around
the
side
of
the
sofa
Ernie
was
startled
to
see
two
people
sitting
there
staring
intently
at
the
television
screen
Hey
Ernie
uttered
involuntarily
The
two
people
seemed
oblivious
to
Ernie
s
presence
Um
hello
Ernie
said
tentatively
Excuse
me
The
people
did
not
respond
Captain
Memory
sighed
It
s
too
late
for
them
I
m
afraid
Ernie
moaned
I
wished
you
d
stop
saying
depressing
things
It
makes
my
stomach
hurt
Oh
sorry
Captain
Memory
seemed
concerned
Um
how
about
It
s
too
late
for
them
I
m
pleased
to
say
That
s
not
much
better
Captain
Memory
shrugged
Hey
I
tried
He
fell
silent
Ernie
looked
at
the
people
They
seemed
frozen
into
position
staring
at
the
television
They
seemed
emaciated
their
muscles
seemed
to
have
withered
in
the
positions
they
were
in
Okay
so
what
s
wrong
with
them
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
They
ve
been
in
Cyberspace
too
long
he
said
sadly
There
s
a
limit
to
how
much
of
this
you
can
take
you
know
Your
brain
burns
out
I
don
t
think
these
two
have
much
longer
All
they
can
do
is
sit
here
in
front
of
the
TV
Captain
Memory
sighed
Terrible
just
terrible
Look
at
them
they
can
t
even
change
channels
anymore
Ernie
shuddered
This
is
gruesome
he
thought
I
think
it
s
bad
for
me
to
look
at
gruesome
things
Oh
well
Captain
Memory
brightened
Can
t
be
helped
The
Captain
unceremoniously
pushed
the
stricken
couple
off
the
sofa
They
fell
stiffly
to
the
floor
motionless
except
for
their
eyes
which
rotated
to
stay
fixed
on
the
television
screen
Captain
Memory
seated
himself
as
comfortably
as
possible
on
the
sofa
So
what
do
you
want
to
watch
They
heard
a
voice
behind
them
Crap
The
dog
was
looking
ruefully
at
his
half
burned
cigar
and
cursing
quietly
What
s
the
matter
Captain
Memory
inquired
cheerfully
I
m
almost
out
of
cigars
the
dog
groused
Here
I
am
stuck
in
this
stupid
pointless
computer
game
and
I
can
t
even
get
a
decent
cigar
Well
maybe
we
can
get
you
some
more
uh
what
was
your
name
again
The
Captain
inquired
Sterno
The
dog
intoned
pompously
Sterno
said
Ernie
dubiously
What
kind
of
a
name
is
that
Sterno
is
those
little
cans
of
heating
stuff
I
ll
have
you
know
that
I
am
Lord
High
Keeper
of
the
Sacred
Flame
Why
in
better
days
Oh
I
remember
now
the
Captain
broke
in
brightly
That
s
a
game
called
DOG
STAR
You
must
have
been
playing
it
when
Waldo
took
over
your
system
That
s
why
you
re
trapped
in
the
body
of
a
dog
Sterno
was
taken
aback
Uh
well
yeah
I
was
Lord
High
Keeper
of
the
Sacred
Flame
huh
the
Captain
continued
You
were
doing
pretty
good
Sterno
brightened
Well
yes
as
a
matter
of
