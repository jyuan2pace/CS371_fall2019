at
Ernie
accusingly
Me
Ernie
protested
Oh
look
the
Fly
broke
in
There
s
an
office
that
s
open
He
pointed
down
a
long
corridor
Great
Ernie
enthused
glad
for
an
opportunity
to
change
the
subject
Maybe
we
can
go
in
and
ask
He
stopped
and
looked
at
Captain
Memory
expectantly
Uh
what
should
we
ask
them
Good
idea
Captain
Memory
agreed
although
Ernie
wasn
t
exactly
sure
what
it
was
that
the
Captain
was
agreeing
with
The
Captain
started
off
briskly
down
the
hall
in
the
direction
of
the
open
office
The
other
three
followed
behind
him
Ah
good
you
re
here
We
ve
been
expecting
you
An
efficient
looking
receptionist
in
a
crisp
white
uniform
greeted
them
cheerfully
See
the
Fly
pointed
out
brightly
They
ve
been
expecting
us
Therefore
we
must
be
in
the
right
place
The
Fly
was
quite
pleased
with
this
leap
of
logic
Ernie
looked
around
They
were
in
a
large
waiting
room
decorated
in
doctor
s
office
green
The
room
was
filled
with
rows
of
chairs
and
an
occasional
table
on
which
there
lay
heaps
of
very
old
magazines
In
the
background
some
easy
listening
music
was
playing
quietly
There
was
as
usual
no
one
else
there
Ernie
moaned
Oh
man
Why
would
they
be
expecting
us
We
re
not
even
supposed
to
be
here
What
s
going
ON
The
Fly
shook
his
head
I
dunno
man
sometimes
you
can
be
just
such
a
downer
Why
don
t
you
like
lighten
up
a
little
Obviously
sniffed
Sterno
We
must
be
in
the
right
place
because
they
are
after
all
expecting
us
How
could
they
be
expecting
us
if
we
weren
t
in
the
right
place
But
Ernie
began
The
receptionist
interrupted
The
doctor
will
see
you
now
She
opened
a
door
to
another
room
Oh
good
The
Fly
was
pleased
You
know
I
ve
been
having
this
pain
in
my
neck
He
began
rubbing
it
vigorously
Maybe
he
can
give
me
something
for
it
He
strode
purposefully
through
the
door
Ernie
shuffled
uncomfortably
I
hate
going
to
the
doctor
Oh
come
ON
Sterno
stood
impatiently
behind
Ernie
Don
t
be
such
a
baby
about
it
Ernie
sighed
and
followed
the
Fly
accompanied
by
Sterno
and
Captain
Memory
They
found
themselves
in
a
large
room
with
a
dozen
chairs
set
in
a
circle
A
few
of
the
chairs
were
occupied
In
one
a
fat
blond
woman
sat
nervously
munching
something
from
a
bag
on
her
lap
Two
chairs
to
the
left
sat
a
very
depressed
looking
young
man
wringing
his
hands
constantly
and
moaning
quietly
He
looked
steadfastly
at
the
floor
never
looking
up
A
little
further
on
sat
a
dishevelled
wild
eyed
man
who
kept
constantly
lighting
matches
Every
time
one
lit
he
would
laugh
hysterically
Against
one
wall
was
a
chair
that
was
larger
than
the
others
In
it
sat
an
older
man
in
an
old
fashioned
black
suit
He
was
bald
with
a
goatee
beard
and
smoked
a
cigar
He
carried
a
notepad
and
seemed
to
be
taking
notes
on
everything
that
was
happening
He
looked
up
Ah
gut
He
smiled
at
the
foursome
You
are
chust
in
time
for
ze
group
therapy
session
Please
sit
down
He
gestured
towards
the
empty
chairs
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
from
the
other
patients
The
foursome
sat
down
Ernie
carefully
placed
the
coffee
maker
by
his
side
Oh
you
must
be
the
doctor
The
Fly
observed
He
looked
around
confusedly
But
what
kind
of
doctor
are
you
A
psychiatrist
of
course
The
doctor
replied
You
have
been
having
hmm
some
problems
in
regard
to
your
appearance
ja
That
s
right
The
Fly
was
amazed
He
turned
to
the
others
I
wonder
how
he
knew
that
Sterno
looked
at
the
doctor
s
cigar
excitedly
I
say
you
wouldn
t
happen
to
have
an
extra
cigar
would
you
The
psychiatrist
produced
one
from
an
inner
pocket
of
his
jacket
Thanks
ever
so
much
Sterno
lit
the
cigar
and
puffed
contentedly
Ernie
was
suspicious
You
ve
got
a
German
accent
he
said
accusingly
The
psychiatrist
drew
himself
up
looking
very
offended
Dat
s
an
AUSTRIAN
accent
he
sniffed
I
have
studied
in
Vienna
with
ze
great
Dr
Freud
himself
He
peered
closely
at
Ernie
Zo
you
have
zis
feeling
zat
you
are
being
persecuted
ja
Zat
everyone
is
against
you
Ernie
was
taken
aback
Well
um
now
that
you
mention
it
yeah
Chust
as
ve
thought
the
psychiatrist
said
scribbling
something
on
his
notepad
Classic
paranoia
Ernie
was
about
to
protest
when
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
two
more
patients
entered
Ernie
looked
up
and
then
moaned
It
was
Lucy
and
Desi
Hi
guys
Lucy
waved
brightly
to
the
foursome
Chick
a
BOOM
agreed
Desi
He
seemed
to
have
acquired
a
new
Cuban
shirt
and
another
pair
of
maracas
They
sat
down
on
the
unoccupied
chairs
across
from
the
psychiatrist
Gut
exclaimed
the
doctor
Now

are
all
here

can
begin
He
turned
to
Lucy
Now

Oh

Lucy
exclaimed

Ach

The
psychiatrist
exclaimed
quietly
Und

Lucy
exclaimed
again
Every
