around
as
well
They
were
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
large
government
office
It
was
a
big
room
with
a
high
arched
ceiling
lit
by
rows
of
fluorescent
lights
The
walls
were
painted
eye
saver
green
It
looks
like
an
old
fashioned
post
office
or
something
Ernie
thought
In
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
long
row
of
tables
with
forms
in
little
pigeonholes
and
pens
attached
by
chains
A
row
of
windows
occupied
one
wall
each
with
a
bored
looking
clerk
doing
something
with
papers
A
sign
above
the
windows
said
Federal
Bureau
of
Drawers
Ernie
was
puzzled
Why
did
you
bring
us
here
He
asked
Captain
Memory
This
isn
t
quite
what
I
expected
admitted
the
Captain
He
seemed
just
as
puzzled
as
Ernie
Actually
I
didn
t
really
want
to
leave
I
really
wanted
to
have
another
piece
of
cake
German
chocolate
as
a
matter
of
fact
He
sighed
I
guess
I
won
t
get
my
cake
now
Ernie
sighed
as
well
He
wished
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
eat
something
while
they
were
still
at
the
cottage
He
was
beginning
to
get
really
hungry
and
it
didn
t
look
like
he
was
going
to
be
able
to
find
anything
to
eat
here
Ernie
looked
around
What
is
this
place
The
Captain
regarded
the
building
thoughfully
I
m
not
sure
but
I
think
it
s
a
database
A
database
Ernie
was
confused
I
thought
data
in
Cyberspace
was
supposed
to
look
like
big
glowing
geometric
forms
that
you
could
fly
around
in
Yeah
well
you
could
do
that
if
you
wanted
the
Captain
explained
But
businesses
usually
don
t
They
secretaries
don
t
like
em
They
like
something
a
little
more
you
know
traditional
Like
this
He
gestured
at
the
building
around
them
Their
discussion
was
interrupted
by
a
shrill
nasal
voice
Next
please
Ernie
looked
around
confusedly
That
s
you
An
unpleasant
looking
older
woman
with
her
hair
pulled
back
in
a
tight
bun
seemed
to
be
pointing
at
him
Step
up
to
the
window
please
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
What
should
we
do
The
Captain
shrugged
I
guess
we
should
step
up
to
the
window
They
did
so
Hello
Captain
Memory
said
pleasantly
to
the
woman
behind
the
window
Can
you
tell
us
why
we
re
here
Certainly
she
said
through
tight
lips
Captain
Memory
smiled
See
he
said
to
Ernie
This
isn
t
going
to
be
hard
at
all
The
woman
behind
the
window
smirked
unpleasantly
Just
fill
out
this
form
She
handed
a
thick
sheaf
of
papers
to
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
s
face
fell
What
s
this
for
The
woman
smirked
happily
That
s
a
form
Request
for
Information
I
assume
you
have
your
authorized
Form
with
you
Uh
I
don
t
think
so
the
Captain
answered
confusedly
What
is
it
Oh
you
must
have
your
Form
Request
for
Request
for
Information
completely
filled
out
authorized
and
validated
before
we
can
process
your
Form
Request
for
Information
Oh
you
don
t
have
a
Form
Here
you
are
The
woman
handed
Captain
Memory
another
thick
sheaf
of
papers
Captain
Memory
looked
very
unhappy
He
leafed
though
the
forms
These
are
real
long
he
complained
Be
sure
to
read
ALL
the
directions
the
woman
simpered
cheerfully
Her
mood
seemed
to
be
improving
with
every
passing
form
And
fill
in
all
the
blanks
except
those
marked
Do
Not
Fill
In
This
Blank
Of
course
if
you
fail
to
fill
in
any
of
the
correct
blanks
or
if
you
should
happen
to
fill
in
any
blank
marked
Do
Not
Fill
In
This
Blank
then
you
ll
have
to
start
ALL
over
again
She
cackled
with
glee
at
the
thought
And
of
course
you
ll
need
a
Form
Request
for
Authorization
of
Forms
a
Form
Request
for
Validation
of
Forms
a
Form
b
Request
for
Instructions
for
Authorization
and
Validation
of
Forms
and
a
Form
A
Application
for
Verification
of
Authorization
and
Validation
She
handed
Captain
Memory
four
more
thick
forms
He
now
had
a
pile
of
forms
about
eight
inches
high
in
front
of
him
And
of
course
she
said
to
Ernie
We
ll
need
a
complete
set
of
forms
from
you
as
well
she
handed
Ernie
a
similar
stack
of
papers
And
from
you
and
from
you
She
handed
the
Fly
and
Sterno
each
their
own
stack
The
woman
seemed
positively
ecstatic
now
Ernie
looked
at
the
pile
in
shock
There
s
there
s
thousands
of
them
Oh
yes
said
the
woman
gleefully
There
used
to
be
only
hundreds
but
ever
since
they
passed
the
Paperwork
Reduction
Act
we
ve
had
far
more
Ernie
regarded
the
papers
with
dismay
After
you
ve
filled
all
those
out
the
woman
continued
delightedly
We
ll
start
on
the
rest
The
foursome
took
their
piles
of
forms
to
the
tables
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
began
leafing
through
them
despondently
These
government
offices
are
always
so
depressing
Sterno
complained
Why
must
they
always
paint
them
that
ghastly
shade
of
green
Ernie
decided
that
he
agreed
with
Sterno
but
he
was
too
depressed
to
talk
He
began
leafing
listlessly
through
his
Form
Application
for
Verification
of
Authorization
and
Validation
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
happened
to
be
