CHAPTER
Um
It
s
not
exactly
what
I
had
in
mind
Ernie
Ross
looked
ruefully
at
his
imitation
fur
loincloth
and
flimsy
plastic
broadsword
Um
I
sort
of
thought
The
girl
behind
the
counter
gave
Ernie
a
sour
look
You
wanted
to
play
the
Goombah
the
Barbarian
Virtual
Reality
Game
right
Uh
yeah
Ernie
replied
The
girl
examined
a
sheet
of
paper
cracking
her
gum
loudly
In
that
case
you
have
to
wear
the
fur
loincloth
and
carry
the
plastic
broadsword
It
says
so
right
here
Ernie
thought
about
this
Well
in
the
ad
it
said
that
playing
the
game
would
be
just
like
being
Goombah
the
Barbarian
There
d
be
monsters
and
wizards
and
everything
just
like
the
movie
That
s
correct
replied
the
girl
Here
at
the
Virtual
Arcade
we
offer
simulated
reality
games
of
just
about
any
popular
character
or
story
line
Our
huge
mainframe
computers

us
to
synthesize
any
reality
in
amazingly
high
resolution
allowing
us
to
believably
create
stories
in
which
YOU
can
be
the
main
character
You
can
step
into
the
role
of
a
commando
a
swashbuckler
a
space
traveler
just
about
anything
that
any
popular
movie
or
book
has
featured
recently
You
can
act
out
the
role
of
your
favorite
character
doing
anything
that
character
could
You
can
actually
BE
your
favorite
fictional
character
You
can
live
out
your
fantasies
for
only
a
few
dollars
a
minute
She
seemed
to
reading
from
a
prepared
statement
Well
Ernie
was
still
unsure
He
had
heard
that
these
games
were
tremendous
fun
They
had
become
very
popular
in
the
last
few
years
You
could
now
find
a
Virtual
Arcade
at
just
about
any
major
shopping
mall
they
were
franchised
Of
course
you
had
to
pay
through
the
nose
to
play
but
nobody
seemed
to
mind
They
were
just
so
much
FUN
I
still
feel
silly
wearing
this
fur
loincloth
and
carrying
this
big
plastic
sword
complained
Ernie
That
s
what
Goombah
wears
in
the
movie
isn
t
it
the
girl
said
looking
bored
Well
The
girl
looked
at
the
clock
If
you
don
t
want
to
play
GOOMBAH
THE
BARBARIAN
I
can
let
you
play
KILLER
LESBIANS
FROM
OUTER
SPACE
instead
I
ve
got
a
game
starting
in
ten
minutes
No
no
that
s
okay
Ernie
protested
A
chime
sounded
Your
game
starts
in
five
minutes
The
girl
warned
Ernie
fluffing
her
hair
absently
Well
I
guess
I
m
stuck
with
this
Ernie
thought
I
paid
my
and
there
s
no
refund
I
hope
this
turns
out
to
be
worth
the
money
Ernie
was
after
all
just
a
college
student
and
didn
t
have
money
to
burn
The
chime
sounded
again
this
time
more
urgently
Second
door
on
your
right
the
girl
said
brightly
This
is
not
starting
off
well
at
all
Ernie
thought
as
he
headed
down
the
hallway
If
this
doesn
t
improve
real
quick
I
m
going
to
file
a
complaint
or
something
Ernie
entered
a
small
cubicle
A
technician
sat
him
down
in
a
large
comfortable
reclining
chair
and
fitted
him
with
the
stereo
goggles
and
headset
that
made
Virtual
Reality
come
alive
He
even
added
the
latest
refinement
tactile
sensation
electrodes
which
he
glued
to
Ernie
s
body
at
strategic
locations
As
Ernie
settled
into
the
new
visions
and
sensations
that
awaited
him
he
began
to
feel
somewhat
better
There
before
him
was
the
mysterious
landscape
that
Goombah
inhabited
in
the
movies
full
of
forbidding
crags
and
castles
shaped
like
skulls
Of
course
none
of
it
was
actually
there
but
the
illusion
was
amazingly
realistic
It
was
hard
to
believe
it
was
all
just
synthesized
artificial
reality
Ernie
was
impressed
Maybe
this
will
be
okay
after
all
he
thought
He
unsheathed
his
huge
plastic
broadsword
preparing
to
be
attacked
by
dragons
wizards
or
any
of
the
other
fearsome
mythological
characters
that
Goombah
customarily
battled
Suddenly
Ernie
heard
a
loud
high
pitched
bark
He
looked
down
and
saw
a
little
white
dog
with
a
black
spot
over
one
eye
The
dos
looked
up
at
him
expectantly
Ernie
was
not
prepared
for
something
like
this
I
m
supposed
to
be
Goombah
the
Barbarian
he
thought
Goombah
does
not
have
any
silly
little
dog
The
dog
suddenly
jumped
up
into
Ernie
s
arms
He
caught
it
automatically
It
peered
up
into
his
face
as
though
expecting
him
to
do
something
This
has
got
to
be
a
mistake
said
Ernie
to
himself
exasperatedly
This
dog
must
be
from
somebody
else
s
game
What
am
I
gonna
do
with
him
Before
he
could
think
about
the
problem
any
further
a
bright
light
in
the
sky
attracted
Ernie
s
attention
Here
it
comes
he
thought
gripping
his
broadsword
tightly
What
will
it
be
a
demon
a
flying
dragon
Ernie
strained
his
eyes
It
s
a
flying
saucer
Sure
enough
it
was
a
flying
saucer
looking
as
though
it
had
come
straight
from
