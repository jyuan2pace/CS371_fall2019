drinking
beer
So
what
are
we
gonna
do
now
guys
asked
the
Fly
sipping
a
beer
through
his
long
flexible
snout
Ernie
started
and
looked
about
confusedly
They
were
suddenly
all
back
at
The
Deer
Bar
His
stomach
flipped
over
again
What
uh
how
did
we
get
back
here
Same
way
we
got
out
said
Captain
Memory
gesturing
towards
the
TV
set
He
looked
momentarily
confused
Either
that
or
maybe
we
never
really
left
at
all
I
forget
which
Oh
well
it
doesn
t
really
matter
Ernie
looked
up
at
the
television
above
the
bar
which
now
was
turned
on
A
sadistic
Nazi
talk
show
host
was
using
a
diabolical
looking
device
to
torture
members
of
the
audience
Uh
do
you
mind
if
I
turn
that
off
asked
Ernie
If
you
like
answered
the
Captain
indifferently
Ernie
switched
off
the
set
and
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Now
they
were
safe
He
frowned
Well
maybe
they
weren
t
safe
but
they
were
safER
He
thought
about
it
a
moment
Well
maybe
they
weren
t
really
any
safer
but
turning
the
TV
off
made
him
feel
better
just
the
same
That
satisfied
him
so
he
returned
to
his
seat
The
Fly
looked
around
Like
we
re
the
only
ones
here
Uh
huh
Ernie
agreed
So
what
happened
to
like
Ricky
and
Lucy
As
if
in
answer
the
door
to
the
bar
flew
open
and
in
staggered
Ricky
his
ruffled
Cuban
shirt
in
rags
his
maracas
broken
Close
behind
him
was
Lucy
her
hair
disarrayed
her
party
dress
torn
and
smeared
with
dirt
You
feelthy
peeg
shrieked
Ricky
enraged
You
send
us
behind
door
numero
four
I
keel
you
What
did
he
say
the
Fly
asked
confusedly
I
can
t
understand
his
accent
at
all
I
think
he
said
he
was
going
to
keel
us
Sterno
volunteered
What
s
that
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
Something
to
do
with
boats
Ricky
advanced
on
the
foursome
holding
his
shattered
maracas
menacingly
Ernie
noticed
that
they
seemed
to
have
acquired
very
sharp
edges
I
keel
you
I
cut
your
brain
out
he
threatened
Ernie
Hey
he
s
starting
up
with
that
brain
stuff
again
Ernie
said
to
Captain
Memory
What
do
we
do
Have
a
beer
said
Captain
Memory
sipping
his
Deer
Beer
That
s
easy
for
you
to
say
It
s
not
your
brain
he
s
after
Ernie
looked
at
Ricky
apprehensively
Why
don
t
you
just
let
him
have
your
brain
snickered
Sterno
You
ll
never
miss
it
Ricky
slowly
staggered
forward
Ernie
noticed
that
Ricky
was
getting
much
more
sort
of
reptilian
looking
He
seemed
to
have
acquired
long
sharp
teeth
and
a
forked
tongue
which
flitted
in
and
out
of
his
mouth
in
a
snake
like
manner
Hey
uh
shouldn
t
we
uh
DO
something
Ernie
urged
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
looked
annoyed
Oh
all
right
He
cleared
his
throat
And
now
he
announced
pompously
A
word
from
our
sponsor
Ricky
froze
Oh
ees
a
commercial
he
said
to
Lucy
We
got
to
wait
Well
I
guess
we
d
better
get
going
fellas
Captain
Memory
said
to
the
other
three
We
ve
only
got
sixty
seconds
He
gulped
down
the
rest
of
his
beer
I
hate
to
drink
beer
in
a
hurry
It
upsets
my
stomach
He
burped
He
brushed
past
Ricky
and
Lucy
who
were
frozen
into
a
state
of
immobility
and
led
the
group
out
the
door
Once
outside
Captain
Memory
checked
his
bare
wrist
Hmm
ten
more
seconds
I
know
let
s
try
this
The
Captain
led
the
group
around
the
side
of
the
building
where
they
could
not
be
seen
from
the
main
door
Fifteen
seconds
later
Ricky
and
Lucy
burst
out
of
the
bar
door
Where
dey
go
Ricky
screamed
Dey
not
suppose
to
move
during
de
commercial
Dey
got
to
wait
for
de
show
to
start
again
Ricky
and
Lucy
looked
quickly
around
and
then
charged
off
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
bank
The
Fly
peeked
around
the
corner
Looks
like
they
re
gone
Ernie
frowned
Are
these
aliens
really
that
stupid
he
asked
the
Captain
I
m
afraid
so
Captain
Memory
replied
Ernie
frowned
Something
about
this
didn
t
seem
to
make
sense
If
they
re
so
stupid
how
come
they
ve
got
interstellar
travel
and
blasters
and
stuff
like
that
he
asked
pointedly
Well
you
know
aliens
have
brother
in
laws
too
Captain
Memory
explained
Brothers
in
law
Sterno
corrected
Uh
right
the
Captain
went
on
Uh
relatives
They
have
relatives
too
Everybody
has
relatives
So
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Captain
Memory
sighed
Well
what
do
you
do
if
your
brother
in
law
needs
a
job
but
he
s
not
too
um
bright
I
mean
you
can
t
leave
him
to
starve
right
After
all
he
s
married
to
your
sister
Okay
so
maybe
your
sister
doesn
t
have
real
good
taste
in
men
she
s
still
your
sister
right
And
what
about
your
nephews
Get
to
the
point
Sterno
demanded
impatiently
Okay
okay
Captain
Memory
went
on
Anyway
you
ve
got
to
get
him
a
job
but
you
don
t
want
to
get
him
anything
too
like
visible
because
you
know
he
s
going
to
screw
it
up
and
you
ll
get
blamed
So
you
