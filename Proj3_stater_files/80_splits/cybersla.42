about
it
just
in
case
he
was
wrong
He
was
sick
of
being
made
fun
of
I
wonder
where
this
road
leads
Ernie
speculated
Rome
Sterno
answered
with
certainty
How
do
you
know
Ernie
was
skeptical
Everybody
knows
that
Sterno
answered
with
authority
All
Roads
Lead
to
Rome
Hey
that
ll
be
fun
the
Fly
chimed
in
Maybe
we
can
get
togas
Maybe
we
can
have
a
Toga
party
He
started
chanting
Toga
Toga
Toga
Yeah
maybe
we
can
get
shot
full
of
arrows
by
the
Huns
too
Ernie
added
glumly
They
began
walking
down
the
yellow
brick
road
In
the
distance
a
pall
of
smoke
rose
from
nearby
pillaged
villages
Hey
there
s
a
building
up
ahead
the
Fly
observed
They
walked
nearer
Oh
it
s
a
Roman
villa
They
re
supposed
to
be
very
luxurious
Let
s
take
a
look
at
it
Ernie
was
doubtful
What
if
it
s
been
pillaged
Don
t
be
ridiculous
Sterno
snapped
It
s
a
villa
not
a
village
You
can
t
very
well
pillage
a
villa
It
doesn
t
even
rhyme
Oh
sorry
Ernie
felt
like
he
just
couldn
t
stop
making
mistakes
They
education
they
give
young
people
these
days
Sterno
sniffed
It
s
just
a
disgrace
Whatever
happened
to
the
classical
education
Where
I
come
from
EVERYONE
who
is
ANYONE
has
a
classical
education
I
don
t
have
a
classical
education
the
Fly
commented
My
point
exactly
Sterno
smirked
The
Fly
frowned
Hey
are
you
putting
me
down
or
something
Oh
perish
forbid
said
Sterno
sneeringly
Far
be
it
from
me
to
put
you
down
when
you
do
such
a
wonderful
job
of
it
yourself
Oh
uh
thanks
The
Fly
seemed
confused
He
brightened
Say
do
you
suppose
there
ll
be
any
beautiful
harem
girls
in
that
villa
Sterno
looked
disgusted
This
is
ROME
They
don
t
have
harems
in
ROME
Only
the
Arabs
have
harems
Aww
The
Fly
seemed
deeply
disappointed
A
thought
occurred
to
Ernie
Hey
this
is
ancient
Rome
You
just
noticed
that
Sterno
said
sarcastically
I
ll
bet
this
has
something
to
do
with
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Sterno
sighed
disgustedly
Will
you
PLEASE
get
off
that
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
business
You
are
the
only
person
I
know
who
organizes
their
entire
life
around
articles
in
sensational
tabloids
Why
can
t
you
worry
about
something
serious
like
alien
Elvis
clones
A
serious
look
came
over
Ernie
s
face
Do
you
suppose
I
should
Sterno
sighed
again
Hopeless
They
approached
the
villa
A
large
white
marble
porch
held
up
by
Roman
columns
greeted
them
Ernie
noticed
something
moving
in
the
shadows
nearby
The
Fly
peered
at
it
Oh
it
s
a
horse
he
exclaimed
The
horse
walked
towards
them
out
of
the
shadows
Ernie
saw
it
was
a
good
sized
palomino
well
groomed
wearing
a
bridle
Something
looked
a
bit
odd
about
it
but
in
this
light
Ernie
couldn
t
tell
what
it
was
But
then
he
didn
t
really
know
that
much
about
horses
anyway
The
horse
approached
them
Hi
there
the
horse
said
in
a
deep
drawling
voice
Sterno
started
A
talking
horse
The
horse
started
A
talking
dog
Ernie
sighed
A
talking
horse
right
I
guess
I
might
have
expected
something
like
that
What
next
There
was
a
time
when
all
of
this
would
have
seemed
very
unusual
to
him
perhaps
even
startling
Now
however
it
was
getting
kind
of
routine
The
horse
regained
its
composure
Say
have
any
of
you
guys
seen
my
friend
Wilbur
around
here
The
Fly
regarded
the
horse
carefully
You
know
this
horse
looks
very
familiar
That
voice
sounds
familiar
too
The
horse
tossed
his
mane
Oh
maybe
you
ve
seen
my
TV
show
My
name
is
Mr
Ed
Sure
cried
the
Fly
gleefully
I
used
to
love
that
show
He
began
to
sing
A
horse
is
a
horse
of
course
of
course
Will
you
please
stop
singing
that
stupid
song
snapped
Sterno
irritatedly
I
ve
always
hated
that
song
You
don
t
like
the
theme
song
asked
Mr
Ed
incredulously
But
everybody
likes
the
theme
song
It
s
one
of
the
most
popular
parts
of
the
show
Well
I
don
t
Sterno
barked
Mr
Ed
pawed
the
ground
Well
I
guess
that
s
all
you
can
expect
from
a
talking
dog
Sterno
glared
Where
I
come
from
we
grind
up
animals
like
you
and
feed
them
to
our
pet
humans
Mr
Ed
whinnied
Let
s
not
get
personal
now
Hmmph
Sterno
fell
silent
Well
said
the
Fly
hesitantly
I
liked
the
theme
song
Thank
you
said
Mr
Ed
I
m
glad
somebody
here
has
some
taste
Gee
it
s
really
neat
to
actually
meet
Mr
Ed
the
Fly
enthused
You
know
I
always
thought
your
voice
was
like
a
special
effect
or
something
A
what
asked
the
horse
You
know
like
dubbed
or
something
the
Fly
explained
I
mean
I
thought
you
weren
t
really
talking
Why
would
you
think
a
thing
like
that
Mr
Ed
wondered
A
thought
occurred
to
Ernie
Say
Mr
Ed
he
said
to
the
horse
What
are
you
doing
in
ancient
Rome
anyway
Mr
Ed
tossed
his
mane
You
know
he
said
thoughtfully
I
was
just
asking
myself
that
very
question
Ernie
narrowed
his
eyes
suspiciously
That
didn
