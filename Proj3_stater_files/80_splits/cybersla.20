bearings
Well
I
hope
you
re
satisfied
Sterno
said
contemptuously
to
Ernie
You
ve
really
made
a
mess
of
things
now
Me
cried
Ernie
Hey
I
m
not
the
one
who
left
those
cigar
butts
back
in
four
billion
B
C
It
s
not
MY
fault
Oh
sure
Sterno
interrupted
Try
and
blame
it
on
me
Hey
guys
the
Fly
broke
in
Look
at
that
The
Fly
s
huge
multi
faceted
eyes
had
picked
up
a
detail
the
others
had
failed
to
notice
behind
the
bank
was
a
small
flat
roofed
brick
building
A
neon
sign
proclaimed
Deer
Bar
There
was
a
large
picture
of
a
deer
beneath
it
Hey
guys
it
s
a
bar
the
Fly
continued
Whaddya
say
we
stop
in
for
a
drink
Hey
maybe
we
can
meet
some
girls
The
others
looked
at
each
others
confusedly
Hey
it
s
okay
guys
The
Fly
went
on
I
ll
buy
Captain
Memory
looked
relieved
Well
in
that
case
sure
Thanks
They
all
started
towards
the
bar
Ernie
was
finding
all
of
this
very
confusing
Every
time
he
thought
he
was
beginning
to
understand
what
was
going
on
events
took
a
turn
in
an
entirely
different
direction
Wasn
t
this
supposed
to
be
the
Emerald
City
He
didn
t
recall
any
bars
in
the
Emerald
City
And
what
about
that
bank
And
what
happened
to
Judy
Garland
They
entered
the
bar
Well
Ernie
thought
I
m
not
sure
if
this
is
a
good
idea
or
not
but
I
could
really
use
a
drink
Ernie
found
the
interior
of
the
bar
reassuring
It
was
cool
and
dark
It
looked
like
a
typical
corner
bar
with
a
typical
corner
bartender
In
one
corner
behind
the
bar
a
TV
set
was
mounted
but
luckily
it
was
turned
off
There
were
few
other
customers
in
the
place
but
of
course
business
was
always
kind
of
slow
in
the
middle
of
the
day
They
seated
themselves
at
the
bar
They
bartender
a
portly
balding
man
smoking
a
cigar
came
up
to
them
What
ll
you
have
What
kind
of
beer
you
got
The
Fly
wanted
to
know
Deer
Deer
The
Fly
was
puzzled
Deer
Beer
the
bartender
stated
matter
of
factly
This
is
the
Deer
Bar
we
got
Deer
Beer
You
want
it
or
not
Uh
yeah
okay
the
Fly
replied
somewhat
confused
Uh
three
Deer
Beers
Ernie
looked
at
the
Fly
It
occurred
to
him
that
no
one
around
here
seemed
at
all
disturbed
by
the
Fly
s
looks
That
seemed
to
a
bit
odd
He
would
have
expected
the
Fly
to
have
attracted
somewhat
more
attention
But
then
on
the
other
hand
Ernie
thought
it
probably
didn
t
mean
anything
After
all
everything
is
pretty
strange
around
here
Ernie
appreciated
the
opportunity
to
relax
and
have
a
beer
The
Fly
pointed
into
the
darkness
at
the
far
end
of
the
bar
Hey
get
a
load
of
that
babe
he
said
to
Ernie
his
antennae
waving
excitedly
Ernie
peered
intently
He
could
just
barely
see
in
the
dim
light
a
rather
disreputable
looking
young
woman
with
bleached
blond
hair
and
a
skimpy
outfit
perched
on
a
stool
at
the
far
end
of
the
bar
What
s
your
name
dear
The
Fly
called
out
to
her
Bambi
she
replied
The
Fly
was
encouraged
Hey
whaddya
say
we
Cost
you
bucks
she
interrupted
The
Fly
s
antennae
drooped
dispiritedly
How
come
there
aren
t
any
nice
girls
around
anymore
He
turned
back
to
his
beer
Sterno
looked
about
worriedly
He
sniffed
Something
smells
very
peculiar
around
here
Probably
just
onions
Ernie
was
unconcerned
Hardly
sniffed
Sterno
There
is
something
seriously
wrong
about
this
place
NOW
who
s
paranoid
Ernie
dismissed
Sterno
s
fears
Just
then
the
door
to
the
bar
opened
and
a
woman
walked
in
She
had
flaming
red
hair
and
was
wearing
a
s
style
party
dress
Hi
there
fellas
she
said
loudly
HI
The
Fly
jumped
up
his
antennae
waving
excitedly
Say
can
I
buy
you
a
drink
Sure
she
answered
in
a
brassy
voice
Ernie
looked
at
the
woman
Not
my
type
he
thought
Too
loud
He
looked
at
her
again
Something
about
her
seemed
very
familiar
Ernie
was
sure
he
had
seen
her
before
but
he
couldn
t
quite
remember
where
Gee
she
said
to
the
Fly
You
sure
are
different
looking
Where
are
you
from
The
Fly
thought
quickly
Uh
France
Oh
sure
I
know
France
the
woman
answered
brightly
Ooh
la
la
c
est
la
vie
Eiffel
Tower
right
Sure
you
got
it
The
Fly
whispered
aside
to
the
others
Oh
boy
oh
boy
I
m
really
getting
somewhere
now
He
turned
back
to
the
woman
So
like
what
s
your
name
Lucy
she
answered
loudly
The
door
opened
again
and
a
swarthy
man
with
slicked
back
black
hair
entered
He
was
wearing
a
Cuban
shirt
with
huge
ruffled
sleeves
and
carrying
a
pair
of
maracas
The
woman
gestured
towards
the
man
And
this
is
my
husband
Ricky
Aww
the
Fly
s
antennae
drooped
How
you
do
said
the
man
with
a
heavy
Spanish
accent
I
m
Ricky
Ricardo
de
famous
Cuban
bandleader
He
shook
his
maracas
rhythmically
Chick
a
boom
chick
a
boom
Yeah
Hi
the
Fly
answered
glumly
He
turned
to
the
others
