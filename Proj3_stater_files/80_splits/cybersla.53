the
attendant
answered
Attila
thought
a
moment
Are
they
funny
I
believe
so
sire
Well
then
let
s
see
em
With
that
the
foursome
found
themselves
ushered
out
of
the
tent
The
four
of
them
stood
outside
Attila
s
tent
Well
now
what
The
Fly
wanted
to
know
That
s
a
good
question
Captain
Memory
began
Yes
sir
that
Okay
okay
Ernie
cut
him
off
He
didn
t
want
to
hear
that
whole
thing
all
over
again
Let
s
just
get
out
of
here
okay
Everybody
keeps
pointing
at
us
and
laughing
Sure
enough
as
they
looked
around
they
noticed
the
passing
Huns
all
pointing
the
foursome
out
to
each
other
and
making
what
Ernie
was
sure
were
snide
comments
Ernie
in
particular
was
getting
very
sensitive
about
snide
comments
made
at
his
expense
Let
s
go
guys
okay
he
urged
They
began
walking
down
the
yellow
brick
road
heading
out
of
the
Hun
s
camp
Soon
they
were
out
of
the
camp
and
heading
once
again
across
the
green
hills
The
road
rolled
on
before
them
over
hill
and
dale
heading
towards
Rome
maybe
The
road
seemed
to
stretch
on
endlessly
in
front
of
them
Ernie
sighed
It
looked
like
it
was
going
to
be
a
long
walk
After
what
seemed
to
be
a
very
long
time
they
noticed
something
up
ahead
of
them
It
seemed
to
be
a
huge
cloud
of
dust
heading
across
the
countryside
Whatever
it
was
it
was
going
to
cross
the
road
a
short
distance
in
front
of
them
Ernie
strained
his
eyes
Can
you
make
out
what
that
is
he
said
to
the
Fly
Oh
wow
said
the
Fly
It
s
a
cattle
drive
Don
t
be
ridiculous
snapped
Sterno
Cattle
can
t
drive
No
no
the
Fly
protested
It
s
cows
A
whole
bunch
of
cows
Herd
of
cows
Ernie
corrected
Of
course
I
ve
heard
of
cows
snapped
Sterno
Don
t
be
insulting
Well
they
re
coming
this
way
the
Fly
said
As
the
four
walked
along
they
began
to
make
out
more
clearly
a
vast
number
of
cattle
raising
a
huge
cloud
of
dust
with
their
hooves
What
are
all
these
cattle
doing
here
Ernie
wondered
As
if
in
answer
to
that
question
a
lone
figure
on
a
horse
came
galloping
toward
them
Hey
it
s
a
cowboy
the
Fly
said
cheerfully
Hiya
cowboy
He
waved
The
cowboy
galloped
up
to
them
and
stopped
Howdy
Any
of
you
boys
know
the
way
to
Abilene
Ernie
looked
around
Uh
sorry
I
m
a
stranger
here
myself
The
cowboy
scratched
his
head
This
country
don
t
look
at
all
familiar
We
ain
t
seen
a
thing
we
recognize
fer
quite
a
spell
now
Y
all
know
where
this
here
road
leads
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Uh
I
think
it
leads
to
Rome
but
I
m
not
sure
The
cowboy
considered
that
Rome
Is
that
in
Kansas
I
don
t
think
so
Ernie
said
The
cowboy
stroked
his
horse
s
muzzle
Well
Toto
he
said
to
his
horse
I
don
t
think
we
re
in
Kansas
anymore
He
turned
back
to
Ernie
Well
thank
ya
ll
kindly
he
said
tipping
his
hat
He
galloped
back
to
rejoin
the
herd
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
What
do
you
make
of
that
Tsk
tsk
the
Captain
shook
his
head
The
file
corruption
is
getting
really
severe
More
and
more
data
is
turning
up
in
the
wrong
sector
I
really
don
t
know
if
the
system
is
going
to
be
able
to
stand
much
more
of
this
Ernie
found
this
comment
disturbing
Why
What
ll
happen
then
The
Captain
shook
his
head
sadly
Well
well
it
might
He
trailed
off
Ernie
hated
it
when
people
trailed
off
It
always
made
him
terribly
uneasy
It
might
what
he
prompted
Captain
Memory
looked
uncomfortable
Are
you
sure
you
want
to
know
Ernie
thought
about
this
for
a
moment
and
decided
the
Captain
was
right
he
didn
t
want
to
know
The
Fly
however
had
become
interested
in
the
subject
Oh
I
get
it
we
re
supposed
to
guess
right
he
said
brightly
First
syllable
Sounds
like
He
began
gesticulating
in
a
peculiar
way
as
though
trying
to
act
out
some
unknown
word
This
is
fun
Sterno
grimaced
Will
you
please
stop
making
those
disgusting
motions
I
can
t
even
begin
to
tell
you
how
utterly
offensive
they
look
The
Fly
paid
no
attention
I
know
I
know
it
s
a
movie
star
right
He
began
prancing
about
in
a
very
disconcerting
manner
Is
it
a
dancer
huh
A
dancer
Well
no
Captain
Memory
looked
very
uncomfortable
I
know
I
know
The
Fly
jumped
up
and
down
excitedly
It
s
Fred
Astaire
right
Fred
Astaire
Uh
no
Captain
Memory
shifted
about
awkwardly
Gene
Kelly
The
Fly
shouted
excitedly
It
s
Gene
Kelly
right
Uh
uh
The
Captain
looked
at
the
ground
For
heaven
sake
s
tell
him
already
snapped
Sterno
Nothing
else
is
going
to
shut
him
up
Ernie
winced
He
really
didn
t
want
to
hear
this
If
it
was
bad
enough
for
Captain
Memory
to
warn
him
about
it
must
be
really
terrible
Especially
considering
all
the
terrible
things
the
Captain
had
told
him
WITHOUT
warning
him
He
shuddered
No
he
definitely
didn
t
