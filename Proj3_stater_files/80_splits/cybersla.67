ship
won
t
fly
Hey
be
cool
Ralph
said
comfortingly
Sure
it
ll
fly
It
s
just
a
little
uh
handling
problem
That
s
all
Fly
s
great
Just
doesn
t
uh
handle
exactly
right
It
was
beginning
to
occur
to
Ralph
that
perhaps
wiring
the
framisttater
to
the
quark
generator
might
not
have
been
such
a
good
idea
after
all
Handling
problem
inquired
Sterno
and
he
wriggled
about
trying
to
find
a
comfortable
position
in
the
upside
down
vehicle
Is
this
part
of
the
handling
problem
Hey
it
flies
fine
Ralph
insisted
So
maybe
it
s
upside
down
I
mean
And
sideways
Captain
Memory
reminded
Ralph
Oh
yeah
Ralph
became
quiet
Sideways
Okay
so
it
only
goes
upside
down
and
sideways
Hey
it
s
no
biggie
It
gets
you
where
you
re
going
right
Okay
so
maybe
you
wouldn
t
want
to
take
any
long
trips
in
it
right
now
but
it
get
s
you
Uh
well
it
gets
you
to
the
parts
store
he
concluded
triumphantly
The
parts
store
s
closed
Ralph
Captain
Memory
reminded
him
gently
The
Fly
s
antennae
suddenly
quivered
I
know
he
said
excitedly
How
about
Road
Service
Can
you
call
for
a
tow
Ralph
fidgeted
uncomfortably
Well
um
I
sorta
been
having
this
problem
with
the
towing
company
There
s
this
um
unpaid
balance
Ernie
and
the
Fly
looked
at
Captain
Memory
He
shrugged
Hey
I
don
t
got
insurance
you
know
Captain
Memory
suddenly
perked
up
Hey
Ralph
he
cried
What
about
Warp
drive
Ralph
brightened
and
then
slowly
resumed
his
glum
expression
Uh
well
I
don
t
think
you
wanna
use
the
Warp
drive
right
now
he
shook
his
head
sadly
Captain
Memory
frowned
Why
not
Ralph
fidgeted
Well
it
s
been
kinda
acting
up
a
little
he
explained
I
been
meaning
to
get
something
done
about
it
Just
yesterday
I
said
to
myself
Ralph
you
know
you
really
oughta
get
that
warp
drive
took
care
of
But
uh
you
know
it
s
like
fifty
credits
minimum
just
to
have
em
look
at
it
and
uh
He
trailed
off
Captain
Memory
looked
confused
Didn
t
you
get
the
Repair
Requisition
Voucher
from
the
Main
Office
Ralph
looked
very
uncomfortable
Um
uh
yeah
Well
the
other
night
me
and
the
boys
was
playing
a
little
cards
see
and
I
had
this
great
hand
I
had
three
Galaxies
How
could
I
lose
right
But
I
was
all
outta
chips
All
I
had
left
was
the
Voucher
so
I
said
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
That
s
against
the
rules
Ralph
Ralph
sighed
Well
how
was
I
to
know
the
other
guy
had
five
Nebulae
You
know
what
the
odds
against
that
are
Ernie
racked
his
brains
for
a
solution
to
the
problem
Maybe
we
could
just
sort
of
give
it
a
try
he
suggested
hopefully
Ralph
sighed
Well
I
thought
of
that
but
last
time
I
tried
it
I
wound
up
in
um
Dimension
Captain
Memory
was
startled
Dimension
Oh
no
wonder
He
chuckled
You
sure
don
t
wanna
wind
up
in
Dimension
do
you
Ralph
nodded
his
head
glumly
That
s
for
sure
They
all
fell
silent
After
a
few
minutes
Ernie
heard
the
sound
of
snoring
He
squinted
through
the
near
complete
darkness
the
only
light
coming
from
the
lights
on
the
dashboard
Ralph
seemed
to
have
dropped
off
to
sleep
Captain
Memory
seemed
to
be
nodding
as
well
Lacking
any
better
ideas
Ernie
slowly
worked
himself
around
to
a
comfortable
position
and
fell
asleep
as
well
CHAPTER
It
was
dawn
when
Ernie
awoke
During
the
night
the
Luna
C
seemed
to
have
drifted
quietly
to
the
ground
and
was
now
lying
on
it
s
top
in
the
dirt
Ernie
peered
out
the
windows
The
clearing
was
deserted
but
signs
of
last
night
s
revelry
remained
The
large
iron
pot
was
tipped
over
on
it
s
side
empty
Various
bones
lay
scattered
about
Lying
here
and
there
was
what
appeared
to
be
an
occasional
jackboot
Ernie
tried
not
to
look
at
them
After
a
few
moments
the
others
began
to
stir
The
Fly
moaned
Oh
man
I
hate
sleeping
in
the
car
Look
at
my
suit
It
s
all
rumpled
Only
Sterno
seemed
comfortable
curled
up
in
a
doglike
position
on
the
ceiling
of
the
upside
down
space
taxi
Ernie
twisted
uncomfortably
He
was
feeling
very
stiff
and
achy
after
sleeping
in
an
odd
position
in
the
car
Thinking
about
it
his
stomach
didn
t
feel
very
good
either
Captain
Memory
blinked
confusedly
and
looked
around
Ralph
yawned
The
Captain
looked
pointedly
at
Ralph
Well
he
said
unhappily
I
guess
there
s
no
getting
around
it
is
there
Oh
no
said
Ralph
dejectedly
You
gotta
do
it
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
despondently
You
re
gonna
have
to
call
the
office
Oh
MAN
Ralph
didn
t
seem
to
like
this
idea
at
all
I
hate
calling
the
office
They
always
give
me
a
hard
time
They
ll
probably
leave
me
on
hold
forever
too
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
It
s
gotta
be
done
Ralph
Ralph
sighed
Oh
okay
He
reached
under
the
seat
and
pulled
out
what
appeared
to
be
a
car
phone
He
picked
up
the
handset
and
dialed
looking
very
glum
Hi
Stella
