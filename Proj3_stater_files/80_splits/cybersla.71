we
turn
on
our
Vidicom
sets
on
my
home
planet
all
we
get
is
old
TV
shows
from
Earth
Our
sets
are
very
sensitive
and
your
signals
keep
drowning
ours
out
I
zee
said
the
doctor
thoughtfully
Und
you
find
zis
upsetting
Oh
doctor
cried
Lucy
again
We
re
not
humans
We
re
reptiles
We
don
t
wanna
watch
Earth
TV
shows
They
re
all
about
mammals
Lassie
My
Friend
Flicka
Leave
it
to
Beaver
They
re
all
MAMMALS
We
want
to
watch
our
OWN
TV
shows
About
REPTILES
She
seemed
very
upset
Ach
zo
the
doctor
nodded
Und
you
think
dat
if
you
conquer
ze
Earth
you
vould
feel
better
ja
Oh
doctor
Lucy
seemed
very
agitated
Don
t
you
see
We
ve
got
to
do
something
to
stop
those
TV
signals
We
just
can
t
stand
it
anymore
They
re
driving
us
CRAZY
The
doctor
nodded
thoughtfully
scribbling
notes
on
his
pad
He
thought
for
a
moment
But
you
are
light
years
from
here
so
you
are
just
now
receiving
signals
from
years
ago
ja
Yes
Lucy
agreed
tentatively
Zo
the
psychiatrist
continued
thoughtfully
Even
if
you
stop
ze
signals
today
you
vill
continue
to
receive
ze
signals
zat
have
already
been
sent
You
vill
continue
to
receive
ze
Earth
TV
shows
He
paused
expectantly
for
ze
NEXT
YEARS
NO
Lucy
screamed
She
buried
her
face
in
her
arms
sobbing
hysterically
I
can
t
stand
it
I
just
can
t
stand
it
She
continued
to
sob
uncontrollably
Ricky
patted
her
back
Chick
a
BOOM
he
said
commiseratingly
The
Fly
s
eyes
clouded
sympathetically
Aw
gee
His
antennae
waved
in
consternation
I
hate
to
see
a
woman
cry
Sterno
nodded
sagely
I
suppose
I
can
see
her
point
He
thought
for
a
moment
I
ve
always
rather
enjoyed
Lassie
though
A
thought
popped
into
Ernie
s
head
What
about
Rin
Tin
Tin
Not
bad
Sterno
agreed
thoughtfully
puffing
on
his
cigar
He
looked
almost
like
a
canine
version
of
the
psychiatrist
And
then
there
s
Sgt
Preston
of
the
Yukon
It
wouldn
t
be
a
bad
show
if
only
King
could
get
rid
of
that
silly
fellow
in
the
red
suit
MAMMALS
Lucy
screamed
sobbing
with
renewed
intensity
The
psychiatrist
stroked
his
beard
thoughtfully
Zere
is
perhaps
a
solution
Yes
Lucy
looked
up
expectantly
her
makeup
streaked
by
tears
It
seemed
to
Ernie
that
he
could
see
a
hint
of
something
green
beneath
it
Perhaps
ze
time
machine
the
doctor
seemed
deep
in
thought
Ernie
turned
to
Captain
Memory
in
confusion
Time
machine
he
whispered
It
isn
t
a
real
time
machine
the
Captain
explained
It
s
a
Virtual
time
machine
You
aren
t
actually
travelling
through
time
but
you
might
as
well
be
Like
when
we
went
back
to
four
billion
B
C
Oh
Ernie
was
not
exactly
following
this
but
he
noticed
the
others
glaring
at
him
so
he
decided
to
stop
The
psychiatrist
continued
Perhaps
you
could
go
back
in
time
back
years
und
stop
zese
signals
before
zey
start
Oh
doctor
Lucy
cried
hopefully
Do
you
really
think
it
would
work
Stop
TV
cried
the
Fly
obviously
very
upset
at
the
thought
Oh
no
How
could
we
survive
without
TV
It
would
be
the
end
of
of
The
Fly
tried
hard
to
think
what
it
would
be
the
end
of
Of
civilization
AS
WE
KNOW
IT
he
cried
triumphantly
True
the
psychiatrist
agreed
pensively
Lucy
s
eyes
began
to
fill
with
tears
But
perhaps
the
doctor
continued
slowly
Lucy
peered
at
him
expectantly
The
psychiatrist
went
on
Perhaps
it
would
not
be
stopped
but
chust
changed
a
little
So
dot
it
vould
not
be
a
bother
to
ze
space
creatures
Lucy
sat
up
excitedly
Oh
yes
Yes
She
turned
to
Ricky
Oh
Ricky
We
could
do
it
I
know
we
could
do
it
If
only
we
had
a
time
machine
The
psychiatrist
smiled
Vell
as
a
matter
of
fact
I
chust
happen
to
have
one
right
here
He
gestured
towards
a
door
that
Ernie
had
assumed
was
a
closet
Ernie
was
once
again
suspicious
What
would
a
psychiatrist
be
doing
with
a
time
machine
he
wanted
to
know
Oh
it
is
chust
ze
thing
for
ze
childhood
trauma
the
doctor
explained
You
go
back
in
time
prevent
ze
traumatic
incident
und
ze
patient
is
cured
Ernie
had
to
admit
that
this
did
in
fact
sound
reasonable
The
psychiatrist
peered
intently
at
Ernie
Vhen
did
you
first
notice
dat
you
felt
suspicious
of
everyone
Ernie
was
somewhat
taken
aback
by
this
sudden
change
in
questioning
Um
actually
he
though
about
it
It
started
when
I
first
went
into
the
Virtual
Arcade
Bye
guys
Lucy
interrupted
She
and
Ricky
were
standing
at
the
door
of
the
closet
or
time
machine
or
whatever
it
was
We
re
going
into
the
past
now
so
we
probably
won
t
be
seeing
you
anymore
Take
it
easy
cried
the
Fly
cheerfully
He
was
relieved
that
Lucy
had
stopped
crying
Um
A
thought
occurred
to
Ernie
Does
that
mean
that
you
re
not
going
to
needing
my
brain
after
all
Lucy
s
brow
furled
thoughtfully
She
looked
at
Ricky
He
shrugged
No
I
guess
you
might
as
well
just
keep
it
Ernie
sighed
in
relief
Lucy
continued
If
it
