t
any
money
now
can
they
I
suppose
they
ll
just
have
to
steal
them
then
Uh
Ernie
felt
unsatisfied
by
this
line
of
reasoning
They
can
t
very
well
just
go
out
and
get
jobs
now
can
they
Sterno
continued
After
all
who
d
hire
an
alien
McDonalds
Would
you
really
want
to
buy
a
hamburger
from
an
alien
Ernie
thought
about
the
frozen
alien
and
his
stomach
flipped
over
again
Um
no
Well
that
proves
it
then
Sterno
leaned
back
triumphantly
Ernie
sighed
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
The
others
all
seemed
absorbed
in
their
own
pursuits
Ernie
fidgeted
uncomfortably
His
stomach
growled
He
was
beginning
to
get
ravenously
hungry
He
looked
at
the
kitchen
door
Maybe
he
could
try
the
kitchen
one
more
time
The
kitchen
looked
a
lot
like
something
out
of
a
s
Better
Homes
Gardens
magazine
It
was
painted
in
cheerful
colors
with
cast
iron
trivets
hanging
on
the
walls
as
decorations
Ernie
would
have
found
it
quite
homey
if
he
hadn
t
known
that
there
was
a
Thing
in
the
freezer
Avoiding
the
refrigerator
he
walked
over
to
a
row
of
cabinets
and
began
rummaging
through
them
The
contents
of
the
cabinets
turned
out
to
be
disappointing
There
were
none
of
Ernie
s
favorite
foods
He
looked
through
the
containers
Hearts
of
Toad
No
Poisonberry
Yogurt
I
don
t
think
so
What
s
this
Ernie
grabbed
a
box
of
what
appeared
to
be
peanut
brittle
Great
he
thought
I
love
peanut
brittle
He
was
just
about
to
tear
into
it
when
he
noticed
the
label
Cockroach
Crunch
He
put
it
back
gingerly
He
decided
that
perhaps
he
wasn
t
all
that
hungry
after
all
Ernie
was
just
about
to
give
up
and
go
back
into
the
living
room
when
he
noticed
a
familiar
looking
object
on
the
counter
nearby
He
looked
at
it
more
closely
It
seemed
to
be
an
old
s
style
coffee
maker
It
seemed
to
Ernie
that
he
could
sure
use
a
cup
of
coffee
right
now
He
examined
it
more
closely
Hey
This
is
Bakelite
Genuine
Bakelite
This
must
be
one
of
the
first
coffee
makers
ever
made
What
a
treasure
Plastic
collectors
would
pay
a
fortune
for
this
He
picked
it
up
and
carried
it
into
the
living
room
Hey
guys
Ernie
announced
Look
what
I
found
Captain
Memory
started
as
he
saw
what
Ernie
was
carrying
Wow
Where
d
you
get
that
Ernie
was
excited
It
was
just
sitting
on
the
counter
in
the
kitchen
Do
you
know
what
that
is
Captain
Memory
enthused
That
s
a
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
I
wonder
what
it
s
doing
on
this
planet
Ernie
s
heart
sank
Does
this
mean
I
m
not
going
to
get
a
cup
of
coffee
Captain
Memory
continued
to
enthuse
Wow
A
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
Right
here
Right
in
our
own
living
room
Sterno
who
up
to
this
point
had
not
been
paying
any
attention
looked
up
irritatedly
What
What
kind
of
nonsense
are
you
going
on
about
now
It
s
a
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
I
can
t
believe
it
The
Captain
seemed
really
enraptured
by
it
I
just
can
t
tell
you
how
thrilled
I
am
about
that
Sterno
yawned
Or
rather
I
could
but
I
d
rather
not
be
impolite
So
instead
why
don
t
you
just
tell
us
what
this
thing
is
supposed
to
be
It
s
a
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
The
Captain
was
indeed
very
excited
Sterno
sighed
Okay
We
understand
that
Now
why
don
t
you
just
calm
down
and
tell
us
what
it
s
supposed
to
do
Captain
Memory
seemed
taken
aback
Do
Sterno
spoke
each
word
slowly
and
carefully
as
though
talking
to
a
small
child
What
is
it
supposed
to
do
Captain
Memory
shifted
uncomfortably
Hmmm
lemme
think
Uh
I
used
to
know
that
I
used
to
know
all
that
stuff
Sterno
repeated
himself
speaking
even
more
slowly
and
carefully
as
though
to
someone
who
did
not
speak
English
very
well
What
is
it
supposed
to
do
Ernie
examined
the
device
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Are
you
sure
this
thing
is
really
a
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
Oh
absolutely
The
Captain
looked
very
relieved
that
someone
had
broken
the
awkward
silence
Then
how
come
it
says
Mr
Coffee
on
it
It
s
a
Mr
Coffee
brand
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
What
s
wrong
with
that
the
Captain
wanted
to
know
Ernie
was
becoming
more
and
more
skeptical
So
how
come
it
says
makes
cups
Drip
grind
only
Well
uh
I
m
sure
there
s
a
logical
explanation
for
that
Captain
Memory
said
evasively
I
just
can
t
quite
think
of
it
at
the
moment
Ernie
narrowed
his
eyes
suspiciously
Are
you
sure
this
isn
t
a
coffee
maker
Uh
Captain
Memory
stopped
Suddenly
his
eyes
lit
up
I
ve
got
it
NOW
I
remember
Of
course
why
didn
t
I
think
of
it
Now
I
remember
what
a
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
is
supposed
to
do
Sterno
was
not
impressed
Okay
What
It
makes
coffee
Captain
Memory
cried
out
triumphantly
Ernie
set
the
coffee
maker
on
the
table
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
rubbing
his
head
wearily
Why
did
everything
always
have
to
be
so
complicated
Captain
Memory
looked
around
at
everyone
obviously
disappointed
Sterno
