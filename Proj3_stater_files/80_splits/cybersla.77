cares
barked
Sterno
in
exasperation
Just
pick
SOMETHING
Ernie
peered
at
the
selections
He
was
desperately
afraid
of
making
the
wrong
choice
This
might
be
his
only
chance
to
learn
the
Secret
of
the
Universe
or
something
like
that
He
had
to
make
the
right
selection
Suddenly
he
saw
something
he
recognized
Hey
look
at
this
He
pointed
at
one
of
the
selections
It
s
Sam
the
Sham
and
the
PHARAOHS
See
I
told
you
Play
it
Cried
the
Fly
enthusiastically
Play
it
snapped
Sterno
annoyedly
But
but
Ernie
peered
at
it
more
closely
The
song
is
Walk
Like
a
Man
I
don
t
think
Sam
the
Sham
ever
did
that
song
PLAY
IT
shrieked
Sterno
his
patience
gone
Ernie
frowned
He
looked
at
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
just
shrugged
Well
Ernie
said
hesitantly
okay
He
pushed
the
button
The
ancient
machine
slowly
creaked
into
action
A
rpm
record
dropped
on
to
the
platter
and
the
device
began
to
play
Within
the
first
few
notes
Ernie
knew
something
had
gone
terribly
wrong
The
music
was
growing
louder
with
every
second
much
louder
than
an
old
Victrola
could
ever
have
made
it
in
fact
painfully
loud
This
isn
t
Walk
Like
A
Man
Ernie
cried
A
terrible
realization
hit
him
If
you
took
Walk
Like
A
Man
and
crossed
it
with
Sam
the
Sham
and
the
Pharaohs
you
d
get
Suddenly
it
was
all
too
clear
He
recognized
the
music
plainly
now
Oh
no
Ernie
wailed
It
s
Walk
Like
an
Egyptian
What
yelled
Captain
Memory
The
music
was
too
loud
drowning
out
their
words
He
looked
at
the
others
He
could
see
their
mouths
moving
but
he
couldn
t
hear
a
word
they
were
saying
The
music
was
too
loud
drowning
out
everything
The
music
grew
louder
with
every
passing
second
The
pain
began
to
build
in
Ernie
s
head
He
tried
to
cover
his
ears
with
his
hands
but
found
it
very
difficult
to
do
while
holding
the
coffee
maker
It
didn
t
help
anyway
The
music
was
so
loud
that
it
vibrated
through
his
hand
through
his
head
The
whole
temple
was
vibrating
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
Do
something
he
shouted
The
Captain
shrugged
and
pointed
to
his
ears
obviously
meaning
I
can
t
hear
a
word
you
re
saying
Ernie
looked
at
Sterno
and
the
Fly
They
had
their
hands
over
their
ears
their
eyes
clenched
tight
in
pain
Sterno
especially
seemed
to
be
suffering
his
keen
dog
hearing
more
affected
by
the
sound
than
the
others
Ernie
was
miserable
Not
only
was
he
in
pain
from
the
terribly
loud
music
but
his
very
best
idea
ever
to
go
find
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
had
turned
into
a
disaster
The
music
grew
ever
louder
Ernie
knew
that
excessive
sound
levels
can
be
fatal
They
were
all
going
to
be
killed
by
Walk
Like
an
Egyptian
played
at
a
million
decibels
and
he
didn
t
even
like
that
song
Ernie
tried
to
hold
his
hands
more
tightly
over
his
ears
If
only
the
coffee
maker
wasn
t
in
his
way
Suddenly
it
hit
him
The
coffee
maker
He
set
the
selector
to
Destroy
aimed
it
at
the
ancient
Victrola
and
flipped
the
strength
lever
to
Full
Suddenly
the
Victrola
vanished
along
with
the
cabinet
the
wall
of
the
tomb
half
the
temple
and
just
about
everything
else
Ernie
could
see
In
fact
Ernie
now
seemed
to
be
standing
at
the
edge
of
a
huge
chasm
It
was
so
broad
that
Ernie
couldn
t
see
the
other
side
so
deep
that
he
couldn
t
see
the
bottom
Ernie
felt
a
tap
on
his
shoulder
He
turned
The
Fly
was
pointing
at
the
opposite
wall
of
the
tomb
and
saying
something
but
Ernie
couldn
t
make
out
what
Although
the
music
had
stopped
when
the
Victrola
was
destroyed
Ernie
s
ears
were
still
ringing
so
badly
that
he
couldn
t
hear
a
thing
Looking
at
the
wall
Ernie
guessed
what
the
problem
was
Without
the
other
side
of
the
tomb
to
hold
it
up
the
huge
stone
wall
was
swaying
It
looked
as
though
it
might
crush
them
at
any
moment
Without
thinking
Ernie
aimed
the
coffee
maker
at
the
wall
and
flipped
on
the
power
switch
This
time
his
ears
were
just
barely
recovered
enough
to
hear
the
tremendous
roar
as
the
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
destroyed
the
other
wall
and
everything
else
for
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
As
the
dust
cleared
Ernie
could
see
that
where
the
opposite
wall
had
been
there
was
now
what
seemed
to
be
a
bottomless
measureless
chasm
On
that
side
too
there
was
a
steep
drop
as
though
they
were
standing
on
the
edge
of
an
infinitely
tall
cliff
All
that
remained
was
the
foot
by
foot
patch
of
sand
and
rock
which
had
been
the
inside
of
the
tomb
where
they
now
stood
Looking
around
all
that
Ernie
could
see
was
the
little
piece
of
land
that
they
were
now
standing
on
and
the
sky
Everything
else
appeared
to
have
been
disintegrated
As
the
ringing
in
Ernie
s
ears
slowly
subsided
he
began
to
hear
Captain
Memory
saying
something
Wow
The
Captain
was
peeking
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
That
Psion
Megaforce
Generator
sure
