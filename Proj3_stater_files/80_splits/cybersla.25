at
the
accompanying
illustration
It
was
a
picture
from
an
Egyptian
tomb
showing
a
dog
listening
to
some
kind
of
a
device
with
a
cone
coming
out
of
it
It
reminded
Ernie
of
something
Didn
t
it
look
a
lot
like
the
RCA
Victor
logo
Then
again
maybe
not
He
continued
reading
But
this
is
only
the
beginning
It
would
be
monumental
enough
if
records
of
the
voices
of
the
Pharaohs
had
been
found
but
what
has
actually
been
discovered
is
so
spectacular
as
to
make
the
Pharaohs
seem
trivial
by
comparison
It
was
of
course
phonograph
records
that
the
Arab
shepherd
found
They
were
in
the
form
of
discs
made
of
fine
clay
a
material
much
more
durable
than
the
perishable
vinyl
that
our
present
day
phonograph
records
are
made
of
and
were
packed
in
the
crumbling
remains
of
an
Egyptian
style
case
When
played
at
approximately
rpm
they
produced
voices
much
like
our
own
early
phonograph
records
But
stop
and
consider
These
records
were
found
deep
in
Israel
near
the
Sea
of
Galilee
in
other
words
nowhere
near
the
Egypt
of
the
Pharaohs
There
is
no
evidence
that
the
phonograph
was
ever
used
in
ancient
Israel
what
s
more
they
were
in
an
Egyptian
style
case
and
bore
Egyptian
markings
How
could
they
have
come
to
a
cave
near
the
Sea
of
Galilee
There
is
only
one
way
They
must
have
been
brought
there
from
Egypt
by
the
fleeing
Israelites
Hieroglyphics
prove
that
the
phonograph
was
in
existence
at
this
time
what
would
have
been
more
reasonable
than
for
the
fleeing
Israelites
taking
with
them
the
treasures
of
Egypt
to
take
with
them
this
great
treasure
But
what
would
they
have
used
it
for
What
else
but
for
the
same
use
as
the
Pharaohs
to
record
and
preserve
the
voice
of
their
leader
so
that
his
will
can
be
known
forever
the
voice
of
Moses
Yet
if
this
device
the
phonograph
was
in
the
hands
of
Moses
wouldn
t
he
have
used
it
to
record
the
things
he
considered
of
greatest
importance
In
that
case
wouldn
t
he
have
taken
it
to
Mount
Sinai
Wouldn
t
he
have
used
it
to
record
the
voice
of
God
Himself
Now
you
can
see
why
this
find
has
been
suppressed
why
no
government
no
religious
institution
on
Earth
can
afford
to
let
these
records
be
heard
They
contain
at
the
very
least
the
voice
of
Moses
and
possibly
even
the
very
voice
of
God
There
may
be
things
on
these
records
which
could
change
the
life
of
every
man
woman
and
child
on
Earth
now
today
in
the
th
century
But
will
these
records
ever
be
heard
Or
will
they
be
hidden
away
in
a
secret
vault
kept
from
a
world
that
needs
them
so
desperately
They
must
be
heard
The
people
have
a
right
to
this
knowledge
knowledge
which
affects
each
and
every
one
of
them
in
every
facet
of
their
daily
lives
Right
now
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
where
they
are
being
held
or
by
whom
or
for
what
purpose
But
a
find
like
this
CANNOT
be
suppressed
It
is
to
earth
shaking
too
monumental
Word
WILL
leak
out
people
WILL
be
told
Already
this
has
begun
to
happen
secret
documents
have
been
smuggled
out
incontrovertible
evidence
has
been
uncovered
It
is
beginning
now
it
is
only
a
mater
of
time
before
the
world
learns
the
awesome
truth
about
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Ernie
put
the
magazine
down
Wow
he
thought
This
is
really
heavy
Is
this
for
real
or
is
this
just
more
crazy
nonsense
Did
this
really
happen
or
is
this
just
more
garbage
caused
by
sticking
together
too
many
computer
programs
that
don
t
belong
together
How
can
we
tell
the
difference
Ernie
thought
about
the
problem
This
is
an
important
question
he
decided
We
may
have
stumbled
onto
something
really
meaningful
Somebody
ought
to
look
into
this
Somebody
ought
to
find
out
whether
this
is
for
real
or
not
because
if
it
is
real
it
might
be
really
important
Ernie
stopped
He
hadn
t
the
vaguest
idea
how
somebody
would
go
about
looking
into
a
question
like
this
Ernie
looked
at
Captain
Memory
Here
look
at
this
article
He
handed
the
magazine
to
the
Captain
The
Captain
peered
at
the
article
The
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Get
real
Captain
Memory
tossed
the
magazine
over
his
shoulder
No
really
Ernie
protested
This
is
important
stuff
I
really
think
you
should
consider
it
What
if
this
really
happened
What
if
this
is
like
a
secret
CIA
computer
file
or
something
I
mean
stuff
like
that
could
be
here
right
It
s
possible
isn
t
it
Aything
s
possible
the
Captain
admitted
But
how
likely
is
it
Ernie
heard
snickering
coming
from
behind
him
He
turned
Sterno
had
picked
up
the
magazine
and
was
leafing
through
it
You
actually
READ
this
stuff
laughed
Sterno
Here
s
a
good
article
Princess
Diana
says
I
m
Carrying
Elvis
s
Baby
Or
how
about
I
Was
Raped
by
Killer
Lesbians
from
Outer
Space
Ernie
frowned
Something
about
that
last
headline
sounded
a
little
familiar
Sterno
continued
Here
another
one
Earth
invaded
by
Aliens
Disguised
as
s
TV
Characters
Hey
lemme
see
that
Ernie
reached
for
