triumphantly
Ernie
looked
at
the
teller
suspiciously
Something
very
peculiar
was
going
on
here
However
he
decided
not
to
say
anything
about
it
because
he
didn
t
want
to
be
made
fun
of
I
wanna
talk
to
the
manager
the
Fly
decided
Good
the
teller
sneered
The
manager
would
like
to
talk
to
all
of
you
RIGHT
NOW
The
teller
came
out
from
behind
the
counter
and
led
them
all
into
a
room
which
looked
very
much
like
a
bank
office
There
behind
a
very
large
desk
sat
a
disagreeable
looking
old
woman
with
a
sour
expression
Ernie
somehow
knew
that
the
woman
had
something
unpleasant
in
mind
for
them
Well
it
s
about
time
she
snapped
as
they
entered
the
room
There
s
a
little
matter
of
an
unpaid
balance
to
be
taken
care
of
Ernie
looked
at
the
woman
She
was
wearing
a
severely
tailored
grey
suit
with
her
greying
hair
pulled
back
in
a
tight
bun
For
some
reason
however
she
was
wearing
shoes
that
didn
t
match
her
outfit
They
were
a
brilliant
sparkling
red
The
Fly
approached
the
desk
Hey
I
got
this
check
Just
one
minute
The
manager
cut
him
off
rudely
There
s
a
little
matter
to
be
taken
care
of
first
She
pulled
out
a
sheaf
of
papers
We
have
an
invoice
here
for
Time
Continuum
Repair
and
Reality
Maintenance
which
was
referred
to
our
department
for
non
payment
Which
of
you
is
going
to
take
care
of
this
matter
Sterno
was
becoming
impatient
What
ARE
you
talking
about
The
manager
began
reading
from
the
papers
It
seems
there
was
a
little
problem
with
cigars
butts
left
at
four
billion
B
C
Ernie
glared
at
Sterno
who
looked
innocently
off
into
the
air
twiddling
his
thumbs
It
seems
these
foreign
materials
left
at
such
an
early
point
caused
slime
creatures
to
evolve
into
the
dominant
life
form
on
Earth
Precluding
this
disgusting
development
required
a
maintenance
order
which
took
let
me
see
she
flipped
through
the
pages
and
pulled
out
a
sheet
marked
Work
Order
Here
it
is
one
million
two
hundred
and
fifty
two
thousand
and
three
standard
Earth
years
and
forty
five
minutes
Now
at
per
hour
plus
time
and
a
half
for
overtime
and
double
time
on
Sundays
that
comes
to
she
flipped
through
some
more
pages
One
hundred
and
ninety
five
quadrillion
four
hundred
and
twelve
trillion
seven
hundred
and
seventy
one
billion
two
hundred
and
thirteen
million
three
hundred
and
twelve
thousand
and
thirty
two
dollars
and
twenty
nine
cents
She
peered
at
Captain
Memory
Would
you
like
to
take
care
of
this
balance
at
this
time
Captain
Memory
shrugged
Don
t
look
at
me
I
don
t
have
any
money
The
manager
peered
at
the
Fly
who
looked
uncomfortable
Hey
sorry
but
I
got
obligations
you
know
I
got
car
payments
I
gotta
pay
the
rent
He
trailed
off
The
bank
manager
looked
at
Ernie
Ernie
laughed
This
was
all
just
too
ridiculous
Sure
put
it
on
my
charge
he
said
flippantly
The
bank
manager
smiled
maliciously
Mr
Ernest
Ross
she
said
in
an
disagreeable
tone
of
voice
carefully
writing
his
name
on
the
invoice
with
a
quill
pen
Captain
Memory
looked
at
Ernie
horrified
Oh
you
shouldn
t
have
said
that
he
said
in
an
ominous
tone
Ernie
began
to
get
the
feeling
that
maybe
he
had
made
a
big
mistake
The
bank
manager
looked
up
at
him
Now
when
may
we
expect
payment
Ernie
looked
desperately
to
the
others
They
were
all
pointedly
ignoring
him
Look
he
said
urgently
Forget
I
said
that
okay
I
take
it
back
Oh
I
m
sorry
she
said
in
a
tone
of
malicious
sweetness
I
m
afraid
you
can
t
do
that
Now
will
you
be
paying
in
cash
or
by
check
A
hundred
and
ninety
five
quadrillion
dollars
said
the
Fly
wonderingly
That
s
a
lot
of
money
That
s
more
than
I
make
in
a
week
Ernie
was
beginning
to
panic
No
I
won
t
Forget
it
I
m
not
going
to
pay
that
bill
You
ll
pay
this
bill
my
fine
little
friend
the
bank
manager
cackled
Or
I
ll
take
care
of
you
she
looked
at
Sterno
and
your
little
dog
too
She
laughed
nastily
What
a
witch
the
Fly
commented
Suddenly
Ernie
had
a
brilliant
idea
He
grabbed
a
vase
of
flowers
off
the
desk
yanked
the
flowers
out
of
it
and
threw
the
water
all
over
the
bank
manager
Eeyah
she
screamed
I
m
all
wet
The
Fly
looked
at
Ernie
wonderingly
Why
in
the
world
did
you
do
that
Ernie
looked
at
the
bank
manager
She
was
glaring
and
hissing
at
him
water
dripping
off
her
face
She
was
not
melting
at
all
Ernie
became
uncomfortably
aware
of
everyone
staring
at
him
Uh
well
I
thought
Ernie
stuttered
You
ll
have
to
excuse
our
friend
Captain
Memory
ad
libbed
quickly
It
s
the
stress
you
see
Financial
problems
He
s
not
coping
The
three
began
hustling
Ernie
towards
the
door
The
bank
manager
arose
hissing
and
spitting
You
haven
t
heard
the
last
of
this
she
shrieked
You
ll
see
The
four
rushed
quickly
through
the
bank
and
back
out
onto
the
road
The
stopped
to
get
their
