get
him
a
job
that
pays
good
but
is
um
out
of
the
way
Like
for
instance
interstellar
scout
Sure
he
ll
screw
it
up
but
he
s
millions
of
light
years
away
who
s
gonna
know
Ernie
looked
crestfallen
I
always
thought
they
d
send
you
know
their
Top
Guns
their
best
and
brightest
to
attack
us
You
re
mean
they
send
their
screw
ups
to
invade
our
planet
Captain
Memory
shrugged
Well
you
know
it
s
a
bureaucracy
This
is
the
real
universe
Life
s
like
that
Ernie
sighed
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
Anyway
I
think
it
s
time
to
get
going
He
headed
off
purposefully
down
the
yellow
brick
road
going
in
the
opposite
direction
from
that
in
which
Ricky
and
Lucy
had
gone
The
group
trailed
along
behind
him
CHAPTER
Ernie
caught
up
to
Captain
Memory
as
the
foursome
headed
down
the
yellow
brick
road
So
where
are
we
anyway
he
wanted
to
know
The
Captain
looked
around
Could
be
Kansas
I
suppose
he
said
thoughtfully
You
don
t
KNOW
Captain
Memory
shrugged
You
can
t
expect
me
to
keep
track
of
all
these
PLACES
he
said
annoyedly
Do
you
know
how
many
PLACES
there
are
in
Cyberspace
There
s
there
s
He
hesitated
confusedly
Well
I
don
t
know
exactly
how
many
but
there
s
a
whole
lot
of
them
And
they
keep
changing
all
the
time
too
I
mean
you
can
go
someplace
you
know
real
well
you
come
back
in
a
few
nanoseconds
and
it
s
all
different
It
was
bad
enough
before
Waldo
Stadium
starting
networking
all
these
systems
that
were
never
meant
to
be
networked
Now
it
s
impossible
So
don
t
expect
ME
to
keep
track
of
it
It
isn
t
MY
fault
He
calmed
down
Anyway
he
said
more
composedly
I
guess
it
could
be
Nebraska
Ernie
peered
into
the
distance
What
s
all
that
smoke
He
pointed
to
a
large
cloud
on
the
horizon
The
Fly
looked
searchingly
into
the
distance
With
his
huge
multi
faceted
insect
eyes
he
could
see
more
clearly
than
any
human
That
s
not
smoke
that
s
dust
he
explained
There
s
a
whole
lot
of
trucks
and
cars
and
stuff
heading
this
way
There
s
enough
to
be
an
army
of
em
He
peered
into
the
distance
In
fact
it
IS
an
army
They
got
tanks
and
guns
and
everything
Ernie
felt
uneasy
So
whose
army
it
is
They
Fly
squinted
I
can
t
tell
too
much
dust
Maybe
we
should
just
get
out
of
the
way
and
let
them
go
by
Sterno
suggested
This
seemed
like
an
excellent
idea
to
Ernie
They
stepped
off
the
road
climbed
over
a
picturesque
split
rail
fence
and
made
their
way
into
a
cornfield
where
they
hid
themselves
among
the
tall
plants
Ernie
noticed
a
scarecrow
out
in
the
middle
of
the
field
He
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
but
then
he
decided
to
just
leave
it
alone
In
a
few
minutes
the
first
vehicles
of
the
military
column
began
to
pass
them
Ernie
noticed
that
they
were
armored
personnel
carriers
painted
tan
and
grey
On
the
side
of
each
was
the
insignia
of
a
palm
tree
with
a
swastika
at
the
base
Ernie
recognized
it
from
watching
war
movies
on
the
late
show
It
s
the
Afrika
Korps
he
whispered
to
Captain
Memory
What
would
they
be
doing
in
Kansas
or
maybe
Nebraska
Aha
said
Captain
Memory
quietly
So
that
s
it
Rommel
must
be
advancing
on
Omaha
Therefore
it
will
be
up
to
Prince
Eugene
to
stop
the
Turkish
hordes
at
the
gates
of
Vienna
In
that
case
Colonel
Jackson
must
be
heading
down
the
mighty
Mississippi
at
this
very
moment
taking
a
little
bacon
and
a
little
beans
to
fight
the
bloody
British
at
the
town
of
New
Orleans
That
means
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
wrist
It
must
be
Oh
Ernie
no
longer
expected
Captain
Memory
s
explanations
to
shed
much
light
on
things
although
thinking
about
it
something
about
the
last
part
of
Captain
Memory
s
explanation
did
sound
a
little
familiar
But
then
on
the
other
hand
everything
sounded
a
little
familiar
but
none
of
it
actually
made
any
sense
Ernie
decided
to
try
again
even
though
he
didn
t
have
much
hope
of
success
So
what
s
going
on
anyway
Isn
t
this
supposed
to
be
like
the
Wizard
of
Oz
or
something
I
don
t
remember
any
Nazi
armies
in
the
Wizard
of
Oz
The
Wizard
of
Oz
the
Captain
asked
wonderingly
Whatever
gave
you
that
idea
Well
gee
Ernie
had
thought
it
was
obvious
There
s
this
yellow
brick
road
and
the
bank
manager
was
kind
of
a
witch
and
she
had
ruby
slippers
and
He
trailed
off
So
what
the
Captain
demanded
Well
If
this
isn
t
the
Wizard
of
Oz
where
did
all
that
stuff
come
from
The
Captain
was
annoyed
Sure
some
of
this
is
from
THE
WIZARD
OF
OZ
But
some
of
it
isn
t
Some
of
it
s
from
other
games
or
computer
models
or
databases
or
whatever
happened
to
be
in
the
systems
that
Waldo
s
been
taking
over
And
there
s
no
way
to
tell
what
ll
pop
out
where
or
when
