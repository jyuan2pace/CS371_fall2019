It
seemed
to
be
somewhat
lumpy
and
misshapen
There
seemed
to
be
a
line
going
around
its
middle
almost
like
a
seam
Why
would
a
horse
have
a
seam
the
new
Miss
Galaxy
The
shouts
and
applause
drew
Ernie
s
attention
back
to
the
television
where
the
winning
contestant
was
being
crowned
And
now
The
celebrity
judges
leaned
forward
expectantly
Their
broad
grins
revealed
rows
of
needle
sharp
teeth
Their
forked
tongues
flicked
in
and
out
of
their
mouths
in
anticipation
it
s
CARVING
TIME
The
announcer
whipped
out
a
whirring
chainsaw
and
advanced
on
the
hapless
Miss
Galaxy
who
struggled
feebly
while
the
two
runner
ups
held
her
in
place
Oh
man
the
Fly
complained
I
told
you
I
don
t
like
horror
movies
They
give
me
the
creeps
Let
s
watch
something
else
He
changed
the
channel
A
commercial
was
on
the
new
station
A
man
was
sitting
behind
a
desk
looking
deadpan
directly
at
the
camera
The
phone
on
the
desk
began
to
ring
Does
your
heart
sink
when
the
telephone
rings
the
man
said
Because
of
bill
collectors
constantly
threatening
you
about
unpaid
debts
Hmm
Ernie
thought
As
a
matter
of
fact
it
does
Why
not
call
Acme
Debt
Counseling
Service
the
commercial
continued
We
ve
helped
millions
avoid
the
nightmare
of
bad
debts
We
ll
set
up
a
payment
plan
you
can
afford
and
get
those
bill
collectors
off
your
back
once
and
for
all
Call
today
That
s
an
idea
Ernie
thought
I
don
t
know
if
it
ll
work
but
it
s
worth
a
try
Maybe
they
can
keep
Vito
away
long
enough
for
us
to
get
out
of
here
at
least
He
picked
up
the
phone
and
dialed
the
number
that
was
displayed
at
the
bottom
of
the
screen
Acme
Debt
Counseling
Service
a
woman
s
voice
answered
Yeah
I
just
Ernie
began
Ah
Mr
Ross
A
man
s
voice
cut
in
We
ve
been
expecting
you
I
have
your
file
right
here
in
front
of
me
Oh
Ernie
was
taken
aback
How
could
they
have
known
he
was
going
to
call
You
ll
be
pleased
to
know
that
we
ve
worked
out
a
very
convenient
payment
plan
to
take
care
of
this
matter
the
man
continued
The
collection
agency
has
agreed
to
accept
the
payment
plan
and
has
agreed
to
call
off
Vito
who
was
on
his
way
to
well
we
d
rather
not
say
what
Vito
was
going
to
do
But
anyway
you
don
t
need
to
worry
about
that
now
Everything
is
all
taken
care
of
Ernie
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
This
collection
agency
business
was
really
beginning
to
bother
him
They
seemed
to
be
able
to
find
him
no
matter
where
in
time
or
space
he
was
He
was
really
glad
that
he
wasn
t
going
to
have
to
worry
about
it
any
more
We
ve
broken
this
down
into
small
easy
to
afford
weekly
payments
the
man
on
the
phone
continued
Now
if
you
ll
just
send
in
the
first
week
s
payment
in
cash
of
course
the
man
laughed
You
can
t
expect
us
to
accept
a
check
from
someone
with
YOUR
credit
history
we
ll
get
the
ball
rolling
on
this
Um
how
much
is
the
payment
Ernie
asked
hesitantly
Only
a
week
the
main
exclaimed
glowingly
Hey
don
t
thank
us
it
s
our
job
Uh
um
ahem
Ernie
cleared
his
throat
nervously
The
man
on
the
phone
stopped
There
was
an
awkward
silence
You
re
NOT
going
to
tell
us
you
don
t
have
are
you
Uh
well
Ernie
began
Um
I
don
t
exactly
have
that
much
on
me
right
now
that
is
If
you
could
give
me
a
little
time
a
couple
of
years
maybe
The
man
on
the
phone
sighed
Oh
that
IS
unfortunate
Well
there
may
still
be
something
we
can
do
I
ll
have
to
talk
to
my
supervisor
about
this
Please
hold
The
man
s
voice
disappeared
and
tinny
Muzak
came
over
the
receiver
in
it
s
place
Ernie
sighed
Well
he
hadn
t
really
thought
that
was
going
to
work
anyway
Still
maybe
they
could
come
up
with
something
yet
He
waited
listening
to
low
fidelity
versions
of
s
pop
hits
played
by
the
Million
and
One
Strings
Ernie
sighed
again
He
hated
being
left
on
hold
After
what
seemed
a
very
long
time
the
man
s
voice
reappeared
Good
news
he
exclaimed
cheerfully
My
supervisor
said
we
may
still
be
able
to
work
something
out
Ernie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Great
The
man
continued
My
supervisor
says
that
if
you
don
t
have
the
cash
right
now
we
might
be
able
to
accept
something
else
of
value
instead
Like
what
Ernie
couldn
t
imagine
what
he
might
have
with
him
that
would
be
worth
Oh
I
don
t
know
Just
some
little
thing
the
man
said
evasively
Like
maybe
your
brain
MY
BRAIN
Ernie
shrieked
Now
now
don
t
get
excited
the
man
said
soothingly
After
all
what
s
one
little
brain
among
friends
You
ll
never
miss
it
FORGET
IT
Ernie
slammed
down
the
phone
Mr
Ed
shook
his
head
sadly
I
think
you
should
have
taken
that
deal
he
advised
Forget
it
I
m
not
going
to
give
