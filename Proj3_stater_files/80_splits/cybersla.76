hesitated
That
s
settled
then
Sterno
stated
with
finality
He
glared
at
Ernie
And
I
DO
wish
you
wouldn
t
keep
repeating
yourself
all
the
time
Well
Ernie
began
PLEASE
Sterno
cut
him
off
Ernie
decided
to
just
be
quiet
The
foursome
trudged
through
the
dry
sand
Luckily
the
sun
though
bright
was
not
very
hot
Ernie
hoped
they
didn
t
have
far
to
go
Trying
to
walk
through
the
shifting
blowing
sand
was
very
tiring
The
approached
the
sign
The
sign
seemed
to
be
pointing
to
something
behind
one
of
the
Pyramids
As
they
rounded
the
corner
they
became
able
to
see
what
it
was
Wow
breathed
Ernie
in
awe
A
fabulous
Egyptian
temple
stood
in
front
of
them
Crumbling
columns
towered
feet
into
the
sky
supporting
a
sandstone
roof
that
had
collapsed
at
various
points
In
the
center
of
the
temple
stood
a
large
stone
structure
with
no
windows
and
only
one
door
which
was
closed
After
a
few
moments
Ernie
noticed
that
there
was
a
small
brightly
colored
wooden
building
standing
in
front
of
the
temple
A
sign
on
the
little
building
said
SEE
THE
ANCIENT
UNDISCOVERED
TOMB
Admission
Inside
the
small
building
was
a
portly
middle
aged
man
wearing
a
bright
plaid
suit
and
a
straw
hat
and
smoking
a
cigar
Step
right
up
gentlemen
he
cried
to
them
Yer
just
in
time
Oh
wow
said
the
Fly
obviously
excited
We
wanna
see
the
tomb
Of
course
you
do
sonny
said
the
man
flicking
the
ash
of
his
cigar
Everybody
wants
to
see
the
tomb
Let
s
see
there
s
four
at
two
dollars
each
He
looked
the
group
over
I
ll
tell
you
what
I
m
gonna
do
Because
I
like
yer
uh
He
looked
at
the
Fly
with
puzzlement
face
I
m
gonna
give
you
a
special
price
Only
for
all
of
ya
Gee
thanks
said
the
Fly
enthusiastically
Ernie
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
Hey
that
s
okay
guys
the
Fly
cut
him
off
It
s
on
me
He
handed
the
ticket
seller
a
bill
Step
right
on
in
gentlemen
The
ticket
seller
gestured
towards
the
door
of
the
tomb
As
they
approached
Ernie
examined
the
hieroglyphics
on
the
walls
of
the
temple
Suddenly
one
caught
his
eye
Look
He
pointed
it
out
It
s
the
RCA
dog
And
the
phonograph
This
must
be
Oh
your
not
going
to
start
that
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
business
again
are
you
Sterno
said
irritatedly
Well
Ernie
began
Will
you
PLEASE
stop
saying
that
Sterno
cried
in
exasperation
Ernie
shut
up
The
interior
of
the
building
did
in
fact
look
like
an
ancient
undiscovered
tomb
Mummy
cases
lined
the
walls
Strange
carved
containers
some
shaped
like
animals
lay
on
all
sides
Drifting
sand
lay
piled
up
against
everything
Wow
The
Fly
was
amazed
An
ancient
undiscovered
tomb
I
bet
we
re
the
first
people
to
be
in
here
in
a
zillion
years
An
ancient
wooden
cabinet
caught
Ernie
s
attention
The
figure
of
the
RCA
dog
was
carved
into
it
Ernie
opened
it
gingerly
Aha
he
cried
Look
Inside
sure
enough
was
an
ancient
acoustic
Victrola
type
record
player
Lined
up
neatly
in
slots
were
dozens
of
flat
black
disks
that
could
only
be
rpm
records
See
proclaimed
Ernie
I
told
you
so
It
s
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Cool
enthused
the
Fly
Play
it
Ernie
was
taken
aback
This
could
be
the
greatest
find
of
all
time
It
could
change
the
world
completely
alter
Life
As
We
Know
It
He
had
to
be
very
careful
One
mistake
might
ruin
the
whole
thing
If
he
made
the
wrong
move
the
greatest
discovery
in
history
might
be
lost
forever
and
it
would
be
all
his
fault
Um
play
it
Ernie
hesitated
uncomfortably
Um
I
m
not
sure
Play
it
demanded
Sterno
irritably
You
ve
been
going
on
and
on
about
this
for
for
Sterno
thought
a
moment
Actually
for
BILLIONS
of
years
now
and
we
re
all
just
about
sick
of
it
All
right
here
it
is
Now
play
it
already
Ernie
looked
over
the
machine
warily
Um
I
m
not
exactly
sure
how
to
work
it
He
tugged
at
one
of
the
rpm
records
It
refused
to
come
out
of
it
s
slot
Sterno
sighed
in
exasperation
It
s
simple
enough
Look
He
pointed
to
a
corroded
metal
strip
on
the
bottom
part
of
the
machine
There
were
a
number
of
buttons
on
it
and
a
slot
Next
to
the
slot
Ernie
could
just
barely
make
out
the
words
Insert
Coin
Ernie
searched
through
his
pockets
Um
Oh
all
right
Sterno
snapped
annoyedly
Here
He
handed
Ernie
the
Cadillac
penny
Um
thanks
Ernie
dropped
the
coin
into
the
slot
For
a
moment
nothing
happened
Then
slowly
the
ancient
machine
began
to
creak
into
action
A
small
dim
light
appeared
behind
a
little
square
next
to
the
slot
Brushing
away
the
dust
Ernie
could
just
barely
make
out
the
words
Make
Selection
Oh
wow
said
Ernie
Next
to
each
button
was
a
small
rectangle
which
was
obviously
supposed
to
contain
the
name
of
the
song
Unfortunately
most
of
them
were
so
covered
by
dirt
and
corrosion
that
Ernie
couldn
t
read
them
Um
which
one
should
I
pick
he
asked
in
confusion
Who
