cliffs
in
the
distance
He
seemed
not
to
hear
Ernie
or
if
he
did
he
paid
no
attention
Ernie
hurried
to
catch
up
At
least
you
re
properly
dressed
for
the
occasion
Sterno
commented
to
Ernie
I
understand
fur
loincloths
are
all
the
rage
this
year
Sterno
snickered
Ernie
looked
down
at
his
garment
He
had
been
wearing
it
so
long
he
had
sort
of
forgotten
about
it
If
we
run
into
any
saber
tooth
tigers
Sterno
continued
You
can
just
chop
them
up
with
your
plastic
broadsword
Sterno
laughed
unpleasantly
Are
you
still
carrying
that
thing
Captain
Memory
called
without
looking
back
Hey
it
s
a
forty
buck
deposit
okay
Ernie
sensed
that
they
were
both
laughing
at
him
Gimme
a
break
huh
Hopeless
just
hopeless
Sterno
muttered
amused
Ernie
began
to
be
able
to
make
out
an
odd
looking
object
in
the
distance
It
seemed
to
be
some
sort
of
primitive
building
As
they
approached
Ernie
began
to
see
it
more
clearly
It
seemed
to
be
a
house
made
out
of
huge
slabs
of
stone
Holes
were
cut
in
the
front
slab
for
windows
and
a
door
A
huge
flat
slab
made
up
the
roof
Sitting
outside
the
house
was
a
very
odd
object
It
was
a
wooden
framework
connected
to
two
huge
stone
rollers
There
was
a
seat
on
the
framework
and
a
piece
of
fur
held
up
above
the
seat
creating
a
primitive
roof
How
odd
commented
Sterno
Some
sort
of
totem
object
no
doubt
Perhaps
a
throne
of
some
sort
They
approached
the
house
It
began
to
look
a
bit
familiar
to
Ernie
Those
fur
curtains
on
the
windows
where
had
he
seen
those
before
A
neat
walk
led
toward
the
front
door
At
the
end
of
the
walk
was
a
stone
box
held
up
on
a
pole
There
was
something
written
on
the
box
The
name
confirmed
Ernie
s
worst
fears
F
FLINTSTONE
Hey
guys
Ernie
called
out
Hmm
returned
Captain
Memory
continuing
to
walk
toward
the
house
He
was
as
usual
not
paying
much
attention
to
Ernie
Um
I
don
t
think
we
should
go
in
there
Why
not
Captain
Memory
did
not
even
slow
down
I
ve
got
a
real
bad
feeling
about
this
place
Aww
is
the
big
strong
barbarian
afraid
of
the
little
house
sneered
Sterno
Well
then
he
can
just
stay
out
here
with
the
saber
tooth
tigers
if
he
likes
The
two
of
them
continued
into
the
house
leaving
Ernie
standing
alone
on
the
front
walk
Ernie
looked
around
The
sun
was
slowly
edging
towards
the
horizon
casting
long
menacing
looking
shadows
Ernie
found
himself
anxiously
looking
around
for
places
large
enough
for
a
saber
tooth
tiger
to
hide
in
Well
he
thought
There
s
not
much
point
in
standing
here
I
might
as
well
go
in
Stepping
inside
the
doorway
Ernie
found
himself
in
a
living
room
appointed
with
furniture
made
of
stone
and
wood
Captain
Memory
and
Sterno
had
made
themselves
comfortable
on
the
stone
and
fur
sofa
The
owners
of
the
house
were
nowhere
in
sight
Rather
luxurious
for
the
Stone
Age
don
t
you
think
commented
Sterno
Captain
Memory
was
once
again
engrossed
in
his
copy
of
the
TV
Guide
Ernie
noticed
across
from
the
sofa
what
appeared
to
be
a
roughly
carved
stone
television
set
He
moaned
Whatever
is
the
matter
said
Sterno
impatiently
Hey
guys
Ernie
implored
I
really
think
we
ought
to
get
out
of
here
I
think
this
is
some
kind
of
a
trap
or
something
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
Paranoia
he
commented
The
poor
creature
would
like
to
think
he
s
important
enough
for
anyone
to
bother
persecuting
He
turned
to
Ernie
Who
in
the
world
would
want
to
lay
a
trap
for
you
What
possible
use
could
they
have
for
you
if
they
caught
you
Ernie
shifted
back
and
forth
uncomfortably
Suddenly
an
object
caught
his
eye
Paranoia
huh
he
demanded
What
about
THAT
He
pointed
to
an
object
in
a
dark
corner
Ernie
s
exclamation
was
enough
to
tear
Captain
Memory
s
attention
away
from
his
TV
Guide
He
peered
at
the
object
It
was
a
box
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
lens
attached
to
it
As
they
looked
at
it
it
whirred
quietly
moving
the
lens
back
and
forth
It
s
a
hidden
camera
Ernie
cried
triumphantly
We
re
being
watched
Sterno
was
nonplussed
Where
did
that
come
from
Well
tear
it
out
then
Captain
Memory
said
Ernie
strode
over
to
the
dark
corner
grabbed
to
camera
and
yanked
it
out
of
it
s
mounting
He
dashed
it
to
the
ground
where
it
shattered
revealing
feebly
glowing
electronic
parts
which
slowly
one
by
one
went
out
Well
so
much
for
that
Captain
Memory
returned
to
the
TV
Guide
Is
that
ALL
exclaimed
Ernie
Well
what
else
did
you
want
asked
Captain
Memory
mystified
Look
I
just
proved
to
you
that
this
is
some
kind
of
a
trap
or
something
cried
Ernie
exasperatedly
There
was
a
hidden
camera
watching
us
for
heaven
s
sake
So
you
took
it
out
Captain
Memory
seemed
perfectly
satisfied
So
much
for
that
Ernie
was
getting
very
frustrated
Well
well
what
if
there
s
another
Oh
I
very
much
doubt
that
Sterno
commented
Captain
Memory
was
still
