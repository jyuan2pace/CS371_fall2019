Roman
cheerfully
Giddap
He
snapped
the
reins
Nothing
happened
The
horses
stood
there
totally
immobile
The
Roman
laughed
nervously
Giddy
UP
He
lashed
the
horses
with
the
reins
Still
nothing
From
somewhere
in
his
toga
he
produced
a
riding
crop
and
began
lashing
the
horses
unmercifully
You
vill
MOVE
you
shtupid
animals
The
horses
stood
absolutely
still
totally
unresponsive
The
Roman
turned
to
the
foursome
with
a
nervous
laugh
A
liddle
problem
nothing
to
vorry
about
No
need
to
get
out
He
jumped
over
the
side
of
the
chariot
and
approached
the
horses
menacingly
Uh
Herr
Sturmbannfuhrer
one
of
the
other
Romans
spoke
up
There
is
something
ve
forgot
to
tell
you
The
first
Roman
gave
the
closest
horse
a
swift
kick
in
the
hind
leg
The
leg
broke
neatly
off
The
Roman
jumped
frantically
out
of
the
way
as
the
horse
toppled
slowly
over
and
crashed
to
the
pavement
shattering
into
a
million
pieces
The
first
Roman
turned
on
the
other
Romans
in
a
fury
Idiots
he
shrieked
You
brought
ze
plaster
horses
I
told
you
ve
must
have
ze
REAL
horses
But
but
Herr
Sturmbannfuhrer
the
second
Roman
sputtered
Ze
real
horses
zey
make
doo
doo
on
ze
floor
Dummkopf
shrieked
the
first
Roman
How
can
ve
travel
vith
plaster
horses
The
other
three
Roman
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
Oh
Ve
didn
t
tink
of
dat
Idiots
The
first
Roman
lashed
the
others
with
his
riding
crop
Oh
man
said
the
Fly
sadly
Does
this
mean
we
re
gonna
have
to
walk
after
all
The
first
Roman
stopped
abruptly
and
turned
to
the
foursome
with
a
bright
smile
Oh
no
of
course
not
Dis
is
chust
a
minor
problem
ve
fix
in
chust
a
moment
The
Roman
pulled
some
sort
of
small
electronic
device
out
of
his
toga
and
scanned
the
surrounding
area
with
it
It
beeped
Ah
Ze
solution
to
our
problem
is
coming
right
down
ze
road
An
object
appeared
over
the
horizon
moving
quickly
down
the
road
in
their
direction
As
it
approached
Ernie
could
see
that
it
was
a
large
chariot
pulled
by
four
beautiful
white
horses
It
looked
somehow
familiar
The
four
Romans
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
blocking
the
path
as
the
chariot
aproached
The
man
in
the
chariot
stopped
confused
You
the
first
Roman
shouted
Out
of
ze
chariot
NOW
He
pulled
an
evil
looking
weapon
out
of
his
toga
and
pointed
it
at
the
man
in
the
chariot
menacingly
Make
way
Make
way
the
man
in
the
chariot
cried
out
I
have
no
time
to
waste
I
m
on
my
way
to
the
chariot
races
in
Rome
The
man
in
the
chariot
looked
very
familiar
to
Ernie
Could
it
be
Charlton
Heston
I
have
no
time
to
vaste
either
The
first
Roman
fired
his
weapon
at
the
man
in
the
chariot
who
vanished
in
a
flash
of
flame
Now
he
turned
to
Ernie
and
the
others
Ve
vill
take
ZIS
chariot
ja
Oh
man
said
the
Fly
mournfully
They
re
ruining
all
my
favorite
shows
First
Mr
Ed
falls
apart
and
now
they
disintegrate
Ben
Hur
Even
Sterno
was
now
beginning
to
get
suspicious
Say
he
said
to
the
first
Roman
What
s
your
name
anyway
My
name
the
first
Roman
seemed
nonplussed
You
vant
to
know
my
name
Yeah
Ernie
picked
the
question
up
What
s
your
name
The
first
Roman
laughed
nervously
He
elbowed
the
second
Roman
sharply
Quick
he
whispered
Vot
s
my
name
The
second
Roman
whispered
something
to
him
The
first
Roman
smiled
agreeably
Oh
yes
my
name
I
am
Marcus
Provolonicus
Sterno
froze
in
horror
Provolone
It
s
CHEESE
Oh
my
god
it
s
CHEESE
Run
The
other
three
Romans
suddenly
whipped
out
evil
looking
weapons
DO
NOT
MOVE
shrieked
the
first
Roman
Or
you
vill
suffer
ze
same
fate
as
our
friend
here
He
gestured
towards
the
other
chariot
which
now
contained
only
a
little
pile
of
ashes
The
first
Roman
tore
off
his
toga
revealing
a
Nazi
SS
uniform
underneath
So
our
liddle
subterfuge
does
not
fool
you
eh
he
said
menacingly
Dat
is
most
unfortunate
For
vhich
He
looked
around
quickly
His
eyes
came
to
rest
on
the
second
Roman
YOU
vill
pay
dummkopf
He
lashed
the
man
with
his
riding
crop
But
Herr
Sturmbannfuhrer
the
man
began
SILENCE
shrieked
von
Liederkranz
It
is
impossible
to
get
good
help
zese
days
he
sulked
Ze
quality
of
ze
Cyberslaves
is
not
vhat

used
to
be
He
turned
to
Ernie
and
the
others
Now
you
vill
get
on
zis
chariot
and
ve
vill
be
on
our
vay
Ernie
looked
at
von
Liederkranz
s
evil
looking
weapons
and
decided
to
do
it
the
Nazi
s
way
They
boarded
the
other
chariot
This
time
the
horses
worked
and
they
moved
off
quickly
down
the
road
Hey
this
sure
beats
walking
said
the
Fly
cheerfully
as
they
thundered
along
the
yellow
brick
road
I
dunno
said
Ernie
ruefully
Considering
where
we
re
going
maybe
we
d
rather
walk
Ernie
frowned
Say
he
said
to
von
Liederkranz
Where
ARE
we
going
anyway
Von
Liederkranz
smiled
evilly
You
ll
find
out
soon
enough
Ernie
looked
on
ahead
They
appeared
to
be
approaching
something
Oh

s
a
town
said
the
