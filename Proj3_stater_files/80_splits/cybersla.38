of
you
to
return
the
voice
said
Ve
haff
been
vaiting
for
you
Uh
oh
Ernie
began
I
think
we
re
in
trouble
guys
The
now
familiar
voice
of
the
game
show
announcer
boomed
out
You
sure
are
because
it
s
time
for
WHEEL
OF
TORTURE
There
was
the
sound
of
tremendous
applause
The
entire
scene
erupted
into
blinding
light
The
announcer
continued
And
now
for
our
first
contestant
from
Toledo
Ohio
it
s
Goombah
the
Toreador
My
name
s
Ernie
Ernie
complained
Gimme
a
break
huh
SURE
the
announcer
agreed
cheerfully
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
LIKE
BROKEN
Ernie
heard
uproarious
laughter
Say
the
announcer
continued
I
just
LOVE
your
suit
You
re
missing
a
few
sequins
though
Ernie
heard
laughter
again
this
time
cut
short
in
a
very
artificial
sounding
way
His
eyes
were
beginning
to
adjust
to
the
light
but
he
still
couldn
t
see
clearly
And
here
s
our
second
contestant
from
Des
Moines
Iowa
it
s
Seth
Brundage
the
Human
Fly
Aw
I
wish
you
wouldn
t
call
me
that
the
Fly
complained
It
makes
a
real
bad
impression
you
know
Couldn
t
you
just
call
me
Seth
Sure
thing
Mr
Fly
the
announcer
agreed
jovially
The
Fly
moaned
And
I
m
not
from
Des
Moines
either
Ernie
s
vision
was
beginning
to
clear
up
They
were
unfortunately
back
on
the
stage
of
Wheel
of
Torture
They
seemed
to
have
blundered
or
been
maneuvered
into
the
same
stage
they
had
escaped
from
twice
before
Ernie
just
hoped
they
would
be
able
to
escape
from
it
again
He
looked
out
towards
the
audience
There
was
no
audience
just
empty
chairs
Ernie
looked
around
There
were
no
guards
no
chorus
girls
In
fact
there
was
only
one
person
the
Gestapo
s
greatest
Sturmbannfuhrer
Dr
Heinz
von
Liederkranz
the
man
whose
name
sounds
like
cheese
Ernie
heard
thunderous
applause
Tank
you
tank
you
von
Liederkranz
bowed
in
the
direction
of
the
non
existent
audience
He
then
reached
out
and
shut
off
a
small
tape
recorder
The
applause
ended
abruptly
He
turned
on
another
small
tape
recorder
And
now
on
with
the
show
the
recorded
voice
of
the
announcer
rang
out
Von
Liederkranz
shut
that
one
off
too
Zo
ve
meet
again
Von
Liederkranz
smiled
unpleasantly
Now
you
are
in
my
power
You
vill
tell
me
vhat
I
vant
to
know
Ernie
looked
at
the
empty
chairs
What
happened
to
the
audience
Von
Liederkranz
s
face
turned
hard
Dat
vas
most
unfortunate
Dey
all
refused
to
confess
und
I
vas
forced
to
eliminate
dem
For
vhich
He
looked
around
quickly
Finding
no
one
else
around
him
he
settled
on
Ernie
YOU
vill
pay
schweinhund
he
cried
slapping
Ernie
with
his
riding
crop
Why
me
cried
Ernie
I
didn
t
SILENCE
Von
Liederkranz
eyed
them
all
suspiciously
Unfortunately
I
vill
not
be
able
to
interrogate
you
at
de
moment
due
to
a
um
temporary
staff
shortage
Until
zis
situation
can
be
remedied
I
vill
be
forced
to
keep
you
locked
up
Zis
time
however
you
vill
not
escape
due
to
ze
incompetence
of
guards
Ze
guards

been
liquidated
He
smiled
evilly
Now
you
vill
go
behind
Door
Nummer
One
MARSCH
He
gestured
at
them
with
an
evil
looking
weapon
The
foursome
found
themselves
herded
through
Door
Number
One
which
crashed
shut
behind
them
with
a
very
loud
and
ominous
clang
Ernie
looked
around
his
eyes
slowly
becoming
accustomed
to
the
darkness
They
seemed
to
be
back
in
the
same
large
dungeon
cell
they
had
been
held
in
before
The
room
was
dimly
lit
by
a
torch
attached
to
one
wall
The
far
reaches
of
the
room
disappeared
into
the
darkness
making
it
impossible
to
tell
exactly
how
big
the
cell
was
Oh
man
the
Fly
complained
Not
here
again
This
place
is
no
fun
I
waited
for
my
date
in
here
for
DAYS
man
She
never
showed
up
I
couldn
t
even
get
a
drink
while
I
waited
The
service
in
here
is
terrible
He
peered
into
the
darkness
Waiter
Waiter
He
sighed
It
doesn
t
do
any
good
Nobody
ever
comes
Ernie
peered
into
the
darkness
No
he
couldn
t
see
anything
that
even
remotely
resembled
a
waiter
However
straining
his
ears
he
did
seem
to
hear
something
It
sounded
like
sniffling
and
perhaps
crying
Who
s
there
he
called
into
the
darkness
Two
small
figures
began
to
approach
into
the
light
As
they
approached
Ernie
could
see
that
they
were
children
a
little
boy
and
a
little
girl
They
were
both
dressed
in
German
national
costumes
The
girl
was
wearing
a
dirndl
and
the
boy
was
wearing
lederhosen
and
a
little
alpine
hat
They
both
seemed
very
sad
Ernie
was
surprised
Hi
there
he
said
to
the
little
boy
in
a
kindly
manner
What
s
your
name
My
name
is
Hansel
said
the
boy
with
a
heavy
German
accent
Und
dis
is
my
sister
Gretel
The
Fly
regarded
the
children
Say
you
kids
haven
t
seen
my
date
have
you
She
s
about
five
foot
two
eyes
of
blue
The
children
looked
at
him
uncomprehendingly
The
Fly
sighed
Oh
well
it
was
worth
a
try
Ernie
regarded
the
children
with
amazement
How
did
you
kids
get
here
Hansel
sniffled
sadly
Ve
vas
arrested
