He
never

Well

Captain
Memory
added
in
brightly
It
could
be
worse
How
asked
Hansel
innocently
Uh
Captain
Memory
thought
for
a
moment

He
fell
silent
Hansel
whimpered
It

Ernie
winced
Oh

Ernie
tried
to
think
of
something
to
do
Uh

Hansel
brightened
Oh

frowned

turned
to
Captain
Memory

The
children
jumped
up
and
down
in

of
Captain
Memory
The
Captain
seemed
confused
Well

said
the
Fly

hesitated
Well

up
and
down
excitedly
Tell

Ernie
frowned
How

and
down
excitedly
Tell

JUMP

The
Captain
seemed
unsure
Well

said
Hansel
reassuringly
You

We

And
he
laughed
We
re

not
Gestapo
agents
Gretel
laughed
too
Oh
no
we
re
not
midget
Gestapo
agents
nothing
of
the

How
silly
to

a
thing
Hansel
gestured
at
Gretel
See
Dot

it
Und

Captain
Memory
breathed
a

of

Hansel
and
Gretel
beamed
Now

Captain
Memory
brightly
Uh
he
scratched
his
head
What

Hansel
fumed
Talk
schweinhund
Or

He
noticed
Gretel
glaring
at
him
He
caught
himself
Oh

He
laughed
feebly
You
vill
tell
us
how
you
JUMP
from
place
to
place
ja
Sterno
looked
at
the
children
suspiciously
There
s
something
very
peculiar
about
these
children
he
remarked
He
looked
them
up
and
down
carefully
You
children
he
demanded
What
is
your
LAST
NAME
Hansel
and
Gretel
looked
at
each
other
in
confusion
Our
what
You
last
name
Sterno
insisted
Your
first
names
are
Hansel
and
Gretel
what
are
your
last
names
Even
Germans
have
last
names
Hansel
and
Gretel
put
their
heads
together
and
began
whispering
furiously
between
them
Last
names
Dey

Finally
the
looked
up
Uh
Colby
Dot

Ein

Sterno
stiffened
Do

he
hissed
It

s
CHEESE
COLBY
CHEESE
A
look
of
fury
passed
over
both
Hansel
and
Gretel
s
faces
Dummkopf
Gretel
screamed
at
Hansel
You

ze

show
Und
ve

Hansel
shrieked
back
It
vas
you
You
pick

name
Suddenly
the
door
to
the
dungeon
cell
flew
open
Von
Liederkranz
stood
in
the
doorway
framed
in
light
Zo
he
said
menacingly
My
liddle
subterfuge
does
not
fool
you
eh
Dot
is
most
unfortunate
Now
I
vill
have
to
interrogate
you
meinself
Out
The
entire
group
stepped
out
of
the
dungeon
cell
and
back
onto
the
stage
of
WHEEL
OF
TORTURE
Von
Liederkranz
turned
to
Hansel
and
Gretel
Und
as
for
YOU
They
winced
Such
incompetence
is
not
to
be
tolerated
You
vill
perhaps
step

Door
Nummer
Four

The
midgets
blanched
NEIN
NEIN
Not
Door
Nummer
Four
MARSCH
Von
Liederkranz
gestured
toward
the
door
with
his
evil
looking
weapon
The
midgets
filed
sadly
through
the
door
which
slammed
shut
behind
them
Ernie
heard
two
piercing
blood
curdling
screams
and
then
silence
Shaken
he
turned
to
Captain
Memory
What
what
is
behind
Door
Number
Four
The
Captain
shook
his
head
sadly
You
DON
T
want
to
know
Ernie
thought
for
a
moment
and
decided
that
probably
the
Captain
was
right
Von
Liederkranz
smiled
evilly
Und
now
ze
interrogation
Too
bad
you
did
not
