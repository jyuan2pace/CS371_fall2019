you
know
I
got
a
good
job
a
nice
car
I
paid
a
lotta
money
for
this
suit
He
fingered
the
expensive
silk
lapels
But
girls
nowadays
do
they
care
Naw
all
they
care
about
is
looks
The
Fly
continued
animatedly
He
really
seemed
to
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
get
all
of
this
off
his
chest
I
mean
I
go
into
a
bar
you
know
not
one
of
those
sleazy
places
but
a
nice
singles
spot
where
the
drinks
cost
like
five
bucks
each
you
know
I
figure
maybe
I
can
meet
some
nice
girls
here
So
I
see
some
cute
chick
I
try
to
start
up
a
conversation
and
like
does
she
even
give
me
a
chance
Hell
no
I
mean
she
doesn
t
even
wait
to
find
out
like
what
I
m
all
about
or
anything
It
s
just
gasp
scream
faint
gasp
scream
faint
the
same
old
thing
over
and
over
again
I
mean
what
kind
of
a
way
is
that
to
behave
Don
t
girls
have
any
manners
anymore
He
sighed
Looks
All
they
care
about
is
looks
Gee
that
s
too
bad
Ernie
really
didn
t
know
what
to
say
Thanks
guy
the
Fly
answered
I
really
appreciate
it
I
don
t
get
to
talk
to
too
many
people
around
here
you
know
A
disturbing
thought
occurred
to
Ernie
Is
this
guy
okay
he
whispered
to
Captain
Memory
I
mean
he
s
not
an
alien
or
anything
is
he
Oh
no
laughed
Captain
Memory
He
s
the
Fly
You
saw
the
movie
didn
t
you
Well
yeah
admitted
Ernie
But
I
thought
it
was
well
a
movie
You
see
replied
Captain
Memory
I
told
you
it
could
be
worse
At
least
you
re
trapped
in
Cyperspace
as
yourself
He
s
trapped
as
the
Fly
Ernie
had
to
admit
that
the
Captain
was
right
about
that
Still
it
didn
t
make
him
fell
much
better
Anyway
continued
Captain
Memory
looking
at
the
Fly
The
aliens
are
much
prettier
I
say
said
Sterno
to
the
Fly
You
wouldn
t
happen
to
have
a
cigar
on
you
by
any
chance
would
you
Sure
guy
the
Fly
pulled
out
an
expensive
gold
cigar
case
and
flipped
it
open
Sterno
removed
a
cigar
and
examined
it
Lovely
He
seemed
very
pleased
Havana
no
less
Thanks
ever
so
much
Hey
my
pleasure
The
Fly
seemed
to
enjoy
the
opportunity
to
show
off
his
fine
quality
things
It
seemed
to
Ernie
that
the
Fly
had
gone
to
a
lot
of
trouble
to
get
the
best
of
everything
but
didn
t
have
much
opportunity
to
impress
people
with
it
Are
we
going
to
be
leaving
here
soon
Sterno
inquired
of
Captain
Memory
It
is
awfully
damp
in
here
and
it
rather
bothers
my
sinuses
Ernie
shivered
The
dampness
was
getting
to
him
too
Wearing
only
a
loincloth
as
he
was
he
had
little
protection
from
the
chill
Hey
I
like
the
loincloth
guy
the
Fly
said
to
Ernie
That
s
the
new
in
thing
right
Maybe
I
ll
get
one
You
think
the
girls
would
go
for
it
Ernie
didn
t
know
how
to
reply
Well
I
guess
there
s
no
point
in
hanging
around
here
much
longer
Captain
Memory
decided
After
all
there
s
no
TV
You
guys
gonna
leave
The
Fly
seemed
crestfallen
or
perhaps
antenna
fallen
But
you
just
got
here
He
brightened
Hey
you
guys
are
gonna
go
someplace
fun
right
Can
I
come
Huh
Can
I
Well
Captain
Memory
began
Do
you
know
how
we
can
get
out
of
here
Sterno
inquired
Hey
no
problem
answered
the
Fly
You
can
take
the
out
of
LaGuardia
and
that
ll
get
you
there
in
about
oh
two
hours
forty
minutes
but
if
you
want
the
special
rate
you
gotta
stay
from
Sunday
through
Saturday
but
not
any
Mondays
or
you
can
take
the
out
of
O
Hare
but
then
you
gotta
What
about
the
door
Ernie
broke
in
Oh
The
Fly
was
disappointed
He
enjoyed
showing
off
his
detailed
knowledge
of
travel
arrangements
Yeah
well
there
s
always
the
door
Ernie
looked
at
the
door
It
was
made
of
heavy
steel
and
seemed
to
be
secure
bolted
So
how
do
we
open
it
Just
knock
The
Fly
seemed
to
think
this
was
all
too
simple
and
therefore
not
very
much
fun
Ernie
knocked
He
heard
the
sound
of
a
bolt
being
thrown
back
and
the
door
creaked
open
Outside
were
two
burly
guards
in
black
Nazi
SS
uniforms
Ja
Uh
is
it
okay
if
we
go
now
Ernie
asked
brightly
NEIN
The
door
slammed
Oh
not
like
that
The
Fly
seemed
impatient
You
gotta
use
like
subterfuge
you
know
Here
I
ll
show
you
The
Fly
was
pleased
to
have
another
opportunity
to
show
off
his
expertise
at
something
He
knocked
on
the
door
The
door
creaked
open
again
Ja
I
gotta
go
to
the
bathroom
the
Fly
said
urgently
The
guards
looked
at
each
other
Vhat
are
ve
supposed
to
do
now
Dey
didn
t
tell
us
vhat
to
do
if
dis
happened
They
looked
hesitant
Vell
I
don
t
know
I
don
t
tink
so
Sensing
failure
the
Fly
quickly
switched
tactics
Hey
look
he
cried
pointing
past
the
guards
A
naked
lady
Vhere
VHERE
