to
go
and
spoil
it
Ernie
was
upset
Well
okay
maybe
you
re
right
That
s
not
dinner
table
conversation
But
still
how
do
we
know
Sterno
sighed
The
problem
with
you
is
that
you
have
no
sense
of
smell
I
for
one
would
have
known
if
there
was
anything
wrong
with
these
delectable
little
morsels
Ernie
relaxed
So
this
place
isn
t
an
alien
trap
or
anything
he
asked
Captain
Memory
Oh
no
it
s
a
trap
alright
the
Captain
said
unconcernedly
helping
himself
to
a
dish
of
something
with
custard
and
cherries
in
it
WHAT
But
the
food
s
okay
the
Captain
continued
So
we
might
as
well
have
some
don
t
you
think
He
helped
himself
to
a
coconut
cream
pie
Ernie
suddenly
felt
very
anxious
So
uh
where
s
the
trap
then
Oh
I
don
t
know
the
Captain
went
on
We
ll
find
it
though
We
always
do
He
looked
at
Ernie
s
plate
Say
are
you
gonna
eat
that
Black
Forest
Torte
If
you
don
t
want
it
I
ll
take
it
Ernie
seemed
to
have
lost
his
appetite
Uh
here
Take
it
He
handed
the
dish
to
Captain
Memory
Ernie
s
stomach
was
beginning
to
feel
queasy
again
Stress
he
thought
It
s
not
good
for
me
I
m
gonna
get
an
ulcer
I
just
know
it
Ernie
noticed
an
open
door
in
the
back
of
the
cottage
It
seemed
to
lead
to
a
bathroom
Maybe
I
can
get
cleaned
up
Ernie
thought
The
dust
was
beginning
to
make
him
itch
Inside
the
door
Ernie
found
a
nicely
appointed
modern
bathroom
complete
with
soap
and
fresh
towels
I
ll
bet
I
have
time
for
a
quick
shower
he
thought
He
turned
on
the
shower
and
let
the
water
run
for
a
bit
Nice
and
warm
he
thought
Not
too
hot
Seems
okay
He
took
off
his
toreador
suit
shaking
the
dust
off
each
piece
in
turn
and
got
in
the
shower
Ernie
let
the
warn
water
run
over
him
Well
this
is
much
better
he
thought
relaxing
There
was
a
bottle
of
shampoo
on
the
tub
shelf
He
picked
it
up
and
examined
it
Placental
Protein
Shampoo
Oh
That
was
the
same
kind
of
shampoo
he
used
at
home
Maybe
it
would
get
the
dust
out
of
his
hair
Watch
ouph
phrm
trmp
What
Was
somebody
talking
to
him
Ernie
couldn
t
hear
over
the
sound
of
the
shower
He
stuck
his
head
out
Did
you
say
something
he
called
towards
the
others
Yes
answered
Captain
Memory
I
said
Watch
out
for
the
trap
WHAT
Ernie
leaped
out
of
the
shower
He
was
about
to
run
into
the
next
room
when
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
stark
naked
and
dripping
wet
He
decided
to
take
a
moment
to
grab
a
towel
and
wrap
it
around
himself
he
wasn
t
prepared
to
face
the
ridicule
he
would
have
gotten
otherwise
What
trap
Where
s
the
trap
You
re
holding
it
Captain
Memory
gestured
at
Ernie
The
TOWEL
Ernie
almost
flung
it
away
but
decided
against
it
No
your
other
hand
Ernie
looked
at
his
left
hand
He
was
still
unconsciously
clutching
the
bottle
of
shampoo
This
This
bottle
of
shampoo
Ernie
examined
it
What
is
it
a
bomb
or
something
No
it
s
a
bottle
of
shampoo
Captain
Memory
agreed
So
what
s
the
big
deal
Ernie
felt
a
little
foolish
getting
all
upset
over
a
bottle
of
shampoo
What
kind
of
shampoo
is
it
Captain
Memory
prompted
Placental
Protein
Shampoo
What
s
wrong
with
that
Do
you
know
what
a
placenta
is
Yeah
It
s
the
thing
that
feeds
an
embryo
in
the
womb
Ernie
had
gotten
an
A
in
biology
and
was
proud
of
it
Ever
wonder
what
proteins
from
embryos
are
doing
in
your
shampoo
Uh
now
that
you
mention
it
that
does
seem
a
little
strange
Ernie
admitted
Ever
wonder
proteins
from
embryos
of
WHAT
the
Captain
prodded
Or
what
KIND
of
proteins
I
don
t
like
the
sound
of
this
Ernie
said
quietly
Captain
Memory
went
on
DNA
is
a
protein
you
know
Ernie
thought
a
moment
You
mean
DNA
like
in
genetic
material
like
basic
building
blocks
of
life
the
stuff
that
determines
what
every
kind
of
life
form
is
going
to
be
That
s
right
the
Captain
agreed
Now
what
do
you
suppose
would
happen
to
you
if
you
rubbed
alien
DNA
from
unborn
space
creatures
onto
your
scalp
where
it
could
seep
right
down
into
your
brain
Ernie
looked
at
the
bottle
of
shampoo
uneasily
You
mean
it
could
like
take
over
your
brain
Could
be
Captain
Memory
agreed
However
it
doesn
t
work
all
at
once
It
has
to
seep
in
little
by
little
The
more
you
wash
your
hair
the
worse
it
gets
Ernie
was
suddenly
glad
he
didn
t
wash
his
hair
too
often
He
thought
for
a
moment
So
people
who
wash
their
hair
a
lot
would
get
it
the
worst
right
You
got
it
Captain
Memory
assented
cheerfully
Ernie
considered
the
problem
So
who
washes
their
hair
the
most
Pretty
girls
the
Fly
chimed
in
They
wash
their
hair
every
day
sometimes
more
than
once
I
know
cause
every
time
I
ask
one
out
one
