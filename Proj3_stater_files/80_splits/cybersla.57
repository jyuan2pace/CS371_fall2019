See
the
Captain
said
They
ve
gone
back
to
the
beginning
They
ll
have
to
start
all
over
Ernie
turned
back
to
look
at
the
Marshal
who
had
been
conferring
with
Miss
Kitty
and
Chester
You
boys
are
free
to
go
the
Marshal
said
Just
stay
out
of
trouble
He
went
back
into
his
office
Whew
the
Fly
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Boy
are
we
lucky
to
get
out
of
that
one
You
don
t
want
to
mess
with
Marshal
Dillon
Sterno
stood
back
up
and
brushed
himself
off
trying
to
recover
his
lost
dignity
You
can
put
your
hands
down
now
he
said
to
Ernie
snappishly
You
have
no
idea
how
ridiculous
you
look
surrendering
when
there
s
no
one
there
Oh
Ernie
lowered
his
hands
He
looked
around
So
what
are
we
gonna
do
in
Dodge
City
The
Fly
looked
at
the
Saloon
Look
at
all
those
pretty
girls
in
there
Whaddya
say
we
go
in
for
a
drink
Well
okay
Ernie
couldn
t
think
of
any
reason
not
to
Besides
his
throat
was
feeling
pretty
dusty
after
that
long
chariot
ride
They
got
out
of
the
chariot
and
walked
towards
the
saloon
the
Fly
leading
the
way
They
walked
up
to
the
doors
when
suddenly
their
way
was
blocked
by
a
burly
bartender
Hold
it
right
there
boys
We
don
t
allow
no
Injuns
in
here
Huh
The
Fly
was
confused
That
means
you
The
bartender
prodded
the
Fly
in
the
chest
Imagine
that
trying
to
come
in
here
with
feathers
he
gestured
toward
the
Fly
s
antenna
and
a
war
mask
He
gestured
towards
the
Fly
s
face
The
dance
hall
girls
laughed
derisively
Hey
wait
a
minute
the
Fly
protested
I
m
not
A
shotgun
suddenly
appeared
in
the
bartender
s
hands
I
said
Git
he
said
menacingly
NOW
Okay
okay
the
Fly
backed
off
I
m
gittin
And
don
t
come
back
the
bartender
called
after
them
The
Fly
sighed
as
the
foursome
walked
back
to
the
chariot
Aw
gee
I
never
get
to
have
any
fun
CHAPTER
The
foursome
walked
slowly
back
towards
Ben
Hur
s
chariot
Suddenly
the
lead
horse
reared
up
whinnying
loudly
and
the
four
horses
galloped
out
of
town
as
fast
as
they
could
run
the
empty
chariot
bouncing
along
behind
them
Ernie
was
totally
taken
aback
by
this
Hey
they
started
up
all
by
themselves
he
said
as
the
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
the
horse
s
hooves
drifted
over
them
Can
they
do
that
Well
obviously
they
can
Sterno
sneered
And
it
s
all
your
fault
MY
fault
Ernie
coughed
Why
is
it
MY
fault
Because
it
s
always
your
fault
Sterno
snapped
YOU
didn
t
tie
them
up
Me
Ernie
protested
I
didn
t
know
you
had
to
tie
them
up
Can
t
you
just
like
turn
them
off
or
something
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
Hopeless
Captain
Memory
looked
up
at
the
bright
afternoon
sun
Nice
day
for
a
walk
don
t
you
think
Ernie
looked
down
the
road
It
seemed
to
stretch
endlessly
through
a
scrubby
dusty
semi
desert
landscape
It
looked
exactly
like
the
scenery
he
d
seen
in
hundreds
of
episodes
of
Gunsmoke
It
did
not
look
like
a
pleasant
place
for
a
walk
Maybe
we
could
just
stay
here
he
suggested
hopefully
Just
then
Marshal
Dillon
stepped
out
of
his
office
You
boys
better
get
movin
before
you
get
into
more
trouble
he
said
sternly
I
want
you
out
of
town
before
sunset
Ernie
sighed
Well
okay
maybe
we
won
t
stay
here
then
The
foursome
started
off
down
the
road
occasionally
glancing
over
their
shoulders
to
see
if
the
Marshal
was
still
watching
them
Unfortunately
he
was
After
what
seemed
like
hours
they
approached
a
fork
in
the
road
One
branch
seemed
to
head
off
into
the
mountains
and
another
into
the
valley
They
stopped
Ernie
looked
at
both
branches
of
the
road
Well
which
way
do
we
go
The
high
road
or
the
low
road
I
know
the
Fly
chimed
in
brightly
You
take
the
high
road
and
I
ll
take
the
low
road
Why
Because
then
I
ll
be
in
Scotland
afore
ye
The
Fly
beamed
Gimme
a
break
moaned
Ernie
Wait
a
minute
Captain
Memory
interrupted
What
Maybe
the
Captain
could
come
up
with
something
that
would
get
them
out
of
this
desolate
landscape
Isn
t
it
supposed
to
be
you
ll
take
the
low
road
and
I
ll
take
the
high
road
The
Fly
frowned
No
I
m
sure
it
s
supposed
to
be
you
take
the
high
road
and
I
ll
take
the
low
road
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
No
I
think
it
s
the
other
way
around
No
it
can
t
be
the
Fly
answered
Listen
He
started
to
sing
You
ll
take
the
high
road
That
s
enough
already
Sterno
broke
in
What
difference
does
it
make
anyway
We
re
not
going
to
Scotland
Ernie
looked
around
Okay
then
where
are
we
going
Rome
stated
Sterno
confidently
All
Roads
Lead
to
Rome
Ernie
regarded
the
landscape
skeptically
I
dunno
Rome
that
s
in
Italy
right
This
doesn
t
look
like
Italy
to
me
It
looks
like
He
stopped
Like
what
Sterno
demanded
Like
well
well
I
don
t
