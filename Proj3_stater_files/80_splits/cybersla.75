head
swam
and
he
felt
nauseous
He
closed
his
eyes
tightly
and
put
a
hand
over
his
stomach
I
think
I
m
getting
the
flu
he
moaned
After
a
few
moments
he
opened
his
eyes
carefully
wiping
the
sand
out
of
them
At
first
all
he
could
see
was
sand
Then
he
looked
up
and
saw
The
Pyramids
Ernie
breathed
in
awe
CHAPTER
Ernie
looked
around
The
Fly
was
sitting
in
the
sand
attempting
to
make
sand
castles
Sterno
was
prowling
around
the
sand
obviously
looking
for
something
Captain
Memory
was
still
curled
up
in
a
ball
Ernie
struggled
to
his
feet
and
attempted
to
brush
some
of
the
sand
off
himself
He
walked
over
to
where
the
Captain
lay
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
You
can
come
out
now
He
s
gone
Captain
Memory
peeked
out
tentatively
He
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
and
uncurled
sitting
up
in
the
sand
Whew
I
m
glad
that
s
over
That
was
awful
The
Fly
peered
at
Captain
Memory
curiously
That
stuff
he
was
saying
was
it
true
I
mean
like
about
your
mother
and
everything
The
Captain
looked
puzzled
Um
actually
I
can
t
quite
recall
But
if
it
had
been
it
would
have
been
pretty
awful
wouldn
t
it
Wow
said
the
Fly
in
agreement
He
thought
a
moment
And
what
about
that
stuff
about
being
totally
inad
I
don
t
want
to
talk
about
it
The
Captain
cut
him
off
irritatedly
Ernie
looked
up
and
once
again
beheld
the
majesty
of
the
Pyramids
in
the
distance
They
looked
a
lot
newer
than
he
remembered
them
Wow
he
breathed
We
must
be
in
Ancient
Egypt
right
Captain
Memory
looked
perplexed
Um
well
I
could
be
wrong
but
I
think
we
re
on
a
beach
in
New
Jersey
Ah
well
Sterno
chimed
in
still
sifting
through
the
sand
That
explains
all
these
cigarette
butts
and
ring
pull
tabs
Ernie
stared
at
him
What
are
you
doing
I
seem
to
have
dropped
my
lighter
Sterno
explained
You
haven
t
seen
it
have
you
Ernie
looked
around
Afraid
not
It
s
so
difficult
to
find
anything
in
this
shifting
sand
Sterno
stopped
and
picked
up
something
Here
s
a
penny
Oh
yeah
This
might
be
a
clue
to
they
re
location
Ernie
thought
What
kind
is
it
A
Lincoln
Sterno
turned
the
penny
over
No
a
Cadillac
Ernie
scratched
his
head
Well
that
s
close
I
guess
What
s
the
date
one
it
Sterno
examined
it
closely
B
C
Ernie
s
face
lit
up
Oh
that
explains
why
the
Pyramids
look
new
He
frowned
But
what
are
the
Pyramids
doing
on
a
beach
in
New
Jersey
I
ve
got
it
Sterno
cried
You
do
asked
Ernie
in
amazement
Great
What
He
stopped
Sterno
was
holding
a
small
object
triumphantly
aloft
I
ve
found
it
I
He
stopped
Wait
a
minute
This
isn
t
my
lighter
It
s
just
an
old
BIC
He
flicked
it
A
small
flame
appeared
Oh
well
he
sighed
I
suppose
it
ll
have
to
do
He
placed
it
in
his
invisible
pocket
Ernie
looked
at
the
Pyramids
again
Uh
anyway
as
I
was
saying
Captain
Memory
sighed
loudly
What
s
the
matter
the
Fly
wanted
to
know
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
It
s
a
real
bad
sign
when
you
get
Pyramids
showing
up
on
a
beach
in
New
Jersey
Bad
sign
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
nervously
Captain
Memory
sighed
Yeah
It
means
that
the
fabric
of
Cyberspace
is
coming
apart
We
re
getting
really
close
to
that
final
total
sys
Don
t
say
it
Ernie
pleaded
tem
Captain
Memory
continued
Please
Ernie
begged
The
Captain
stopped
Why
not
Ernie
moaned
It
makes
my
stomach
hurt
Captain
Memory
just
shrugged
Ernie
moaned
again
Hey
guy
the
Fly
chimed
in
He
took
a
small
package
out
of
one
of
his
suit
pockets
and
handed
it
to
Ernie
Here
s
what
you
need
Have
some
Rolaids
Oh
Thanks
Ernie
tried
a
few
Actually
they
did
seem
to
help
Well
maybe
a
total
system
failure
wasn
t
that
bad
after
all
So
what
do
you
wanna
do
now
guys
the
Fly
piped
up
brightly
Beats
me
answered
Captain
Memory
Haven
t
the
foggiest
replied
Sterno
absently
He
was
engrossed
in
trying
to
light
a
cigar
using
the
tiny
flame
from
the
old
BIC
Ernie
looked
around
I
dunno
What
do
you
wanna
do
Wanna
go
see
an
ancient
undiscovered
tomb
That
sounds
like
fun
huh
The
Fly
s
antennae
waved
expectantly
Oh
let
s
answered
Sterno
brightly
He
was
in
a
much
better
mood
now
that
he
d
gotten
his
cigar
going
Ernie
frowned
How
do
you
know
where
to
find
an
ancient
undiscovered
tomb
Simple
the
Fly
replied
cheerfully
Just
follow
the
signs
He
pointed
to
an
object
in
the
distance
Ernie
peered
in
the
direction
the
Fly
was
pointing
Sure
enough
he
could
just
barely
make
out
a
sign
which
said
THIS
WAY
TO
THE
ANCIENT
UNDISCOVERED
TOMB
with
an
arrow
pointing
the
way
Well
Ernie
wasn
t
sure
this
was
going
to
be
such
a
good
idea
Aw
come
on
guys
the
Fly
enthused
It
ll
be
fun
Well
Ernie
was
unconvinced
Do
you
have
something
better
to
do
Sterno
demanded
Well
Ernie
