point
would
be
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
Turning
abruptly
he
sprinted
towards
the
other
side
of
the
hill
half
expecting
to
feel
an
arrow
in
his
back
at
any
moment
As
he
ran
he
could
hear
little
bits
of
the
soldier
s
conversation
drifting
in
his
direction
whaddya
mean
you
don
t
got
any
arrows
I
told
you
to
save
some
arrows
How
come
nobody
never
does
what
I
tell
em
Ernie
ran
for
the
bunch
of
bushes
the
others
were
hiding
in
What
happened
the
Fly
asked
eagerly
We
guessed
wrong
answered
Ernie
glumly
Well
we
better
do
something
said
the
Fly
Cause
they
re
coming
this
way
I
don
t
think
they
can
find
us
in
here
said
Ernie
hopefully
Oh
yes
they
can
returned
Sterno
There
s
a
trail
of
sequins
leading
right
to
us
Ernie
s
heart
sank
He
knew
he
d
never
hear
the
end
of
this
Oh
man
said
the
Fly
You
better
ditch
that
suit
It
s
getting
us
in
a
lot
of
trouble
Luckily
Ernie
still
had
his
fur
loincloth
sandals
and
plastic
broadsword
He
had
been
afraid
to
discard
them
since
after
all
he
had
put
a
forty
dollar
deposit
on
them
He
quickly
changed
into
the
Goombah
the
Barbarian
costume
and
hid
the
toreador
outfit
under
a
rock
No
sooner
had
he
finished
changing
then
they
heard
a
voice
coming
from
behind
them
Hey
what
are
you
guys
doing
in
those
bushes
The
same
group
of
soldiers
Ernie
had
encountered
on
the
road
was
there
behind
them
Ernie
thought
fast
Uh
we
re
looking
for
blueberries
You
guys
see
any
blueberries
around
here
No
answered
the
first
soldier
And
anyway
it
ain
t
blueberry
season
so
why
don
t
you
guys
come
out
of
there
real
slow
The
soldiers
held
their
spears
in
a
menacing
fashion
Sure
whatever
you
say
Ernie
laughed
nervously
The
soldiers
inspected
the
foursome
suspiciously
The
first
soldier
looked
at
Ernie
So
what
are
you
supposed
to
be
Uh
I
m
Goombah
the
Barbarian
Ernie
announced
The
first
soldier
guffawed
Hey
Frank
get
a
load
a
this
This
guy
thinks
he
s
a
barbarian
The
other
soldiers
laughed
uproariously
Ernie
sulked
He
didn
t
see
what
was
so
funny
about
it
What
did
he
say
his
name
was
asked
Frank
Gumby
Gumby
the
Barbarian
The
soldiers
all
laughed
hysterically
Lookit
this
he
s
got
a
plastic
broadsword
A
real
tough
guy
He
doubled
over
with
laughter
The
first
soldier
gradually
composed
himself
Say
he
said
wiping
tears
of
laughter
from
his
eyes
You
didn
t
see
a
Roman
in
a
funny
suit
go
by
here
did
you
He
left
a
trail
of
sequins
that
led
right
in
here
Ernie
thought
fast
again
Uh
as
a
matter
of
fact
yeah
He
went
thataway
Ernie
pointed
down
the
road
The
soldiers
looked
in
that
direction
Aw
we
might
as
well
forget
it
We
ll
never
get
him
now
The
second
soldier
looked
at
Ernie
So
what
are
we
gonna
do
with
Gumby
here
At
the
mention
of
the
name
Gumby
the
soldiers
all
started
laughing
hysterically
again
Gumby
the
Barbarian
huh
the
first
soldier
commented
after
he
had
stopped
laughing
to
the
point
that
he
could
speak
again
Well
I
m
Joe
the
Hun
he
said
introducing
himself
This
here
s
Frank
the
Hun
and
back
there
that
s
Pete
the
Hun
He
looked
at
the
foursome
What
a
weird
bunch
I
guess
we
d
better
take
all
you
guys
to
the
boss
Who
s
the
boss
asked
Ernie
Attila
the
Hun
answered
Joe
That
figures
Ernie
thought
Ernie
decided
that
maybe
he
would
go
along
and
meet
Attila
the
Hun
especially
since
he
couldn
t
see
any
alternative
at
the
moment
The
foursome
headed
off
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
burning
village
escorted
by
the
Hun
soldiers
After
a
few
minutes
walk
they
entered
the
encampment
of
the
Huns
The
soldiers
led
them
to
a
large
tent
where
they
were
ushered
into
the
presence
of
an
imposing
figure
A
large
heavily
muscled
man
in
armor
sat
or
a
golden
throne
leaning
on
a
huge
broadsword
Attila
King
of
the
Huns
a
soldier
announced
Attila
regarded
the
foursome
carefully
Why
have
you
brought
these
creatures
before
me
he
demanded
in
a
thunderous
voice
Uh
well
sir
said
Joe
the
Hun
timidly
We
didn
t
know
what
else
to
do
with
them
He
started
to
giggle
This
one
he
pointed
at
Ernie
He
says
his
name
s
Gumby
the
Barbarian
He
put
his
hand
over
his
mouth
to
stifle
his
laughter
Attila
regarded
Ernie
seriously
Is
that
correct
he
demanded
sternly
Uh
actually
it
s
Goombah
Ernie
said
timorously
Attila
erupted
in
thunderous
laughter
That
s
great
Gumby
the
Barbarian
That
s
hysterical
He
turned
to
the
soldiers
You
guys
dressed
him
up
like
this
for
a
joke
right
No
it
s
for
real
Joe
protested
We
just
found
em
like
this
Attila
doubled
over
with
laughter
Wiping
the
tears
from
his
eyes
he
turned
to
the
Fly
Hey
lookit
this
guy
s
mask
It
s
really
weird
That
s
not
a
mask
the
Fly
was
offended
That
s
my
face
Attila
erupted
into
hysterical
laughter
again
He
says
it
s
his
