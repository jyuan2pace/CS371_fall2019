Whirling
Corkscrew
which
true
to
it
s
name
began
to
whirl
and
glow
Laughing
sadistically
as
usual
he
began
to
bring
it
closer
and
closer
to
Captain
Memory
s
face
The
torture
device
edged
ever
nearer
inch
by
inch
spinning
and
hissing
as
it
approached
Captain
Memory
s
unprotected
face
Ernie
shut
his
eyes
tightly
It
s
too
horrible
he
thought
I
can
t
watch
He
waited
for
the
inevitable
screams
Captain
Memory
looked
miffed
Okay
be
like
that
JMP
F
Ernie
opened
his
eyes
The
rococo
sitting
room
had
vanished
They
seemed
to
be
back
in
the
huge
Chicago
living
room
that
they
had
originally
found
themselves
in
after
leaving
the
Simulation
Arcade
Ernie
s
head
swam
This
is
all
changing
too
fast
for
me
he
thought
I
just
can
t
keep
up
with
it
He
found
a
chair
and
sat
down
Ernie
didn
t
feel
well
at
all
Captain
Memory
was
strolling
around
ruefully
inspecting
the
surroundings
Look
at
this
place
he
lamented
What
a
mess
Ernie
looked
about
The
place
was
in
fact
in
dismal
shape
The
walls
were
covered
with
soot
the
furniture
was
singed
Much
of
the
furniture
was
knocked
over
some
was
totally
splintered
It
looked
rather
like
a
bomb
had
gone
off
in
the
room
Ernie
recovered
enough
composure
to
speak
Why
why
are
we
back
here
Oh
I
apologize
for
that
Captain
Memory
explained
I
just
couldn
t
think
of
anyplace
else
on
such
short
notice
I
should
have
known
this
place
would
be
a
mess
Ernie
looked
around
Yeah
this
place
has
really
gone
to
the
dogs
I
suppose
you
think
that
s
funny
Sterno
growled
Ernie
noticed
two
piles
of
burned
rags
lying
near
the
TV
set
They
were
still
smoldering
slightly
He
shuddered
He
would
rather
not
think
about
what
might
have
happened
here
Well
well
Ernie
started
again
How
did
we
get
here
That
Nazi
said
we
couldn
t
escape
He
said
they
controlled
all
computation
in
the
sector
That
s
right
Captain
Memory
smiled
We
JUMPed
to
a
different
sector
Ernie
decided
to
just
accept
that
explanation
even
though
he
didn
t
entirely
understand
it
Makes
about
as
much
sense
as
anything
else
Sterno
agreed
He
seemed
to
have
found
another
cigar
and
was
puffing
away
on
it
contentedly
He
seemed
to
be
in
a
much
better
mood
whenever
he
had
a
cigar
Pity
you
couldn
t
have
transported
that
brandy
along
with
us
though
Ernie
was
desperately
trying
to
make
sense
of
all
of
this
So
who
were
those
Nazi
guys
anyway
That
s
hard
to
say
for
sure
CM
said
thoughtfully
They
re
probably
Cyberslaves
just
like
you
would
have
been
if
I
hadn
t
rescued
you
Ernie
shuddered
He
really
didn
t
like
the
sound
of
that
Cyberslave
stuff
What
about
their
leader
Von
Liederkranz
Sterno
wondered
He
didn
t
look
a
slave
In
fact
he
seemed
to
be
having
a
really
good
time
The
Captain
nodded
I
m
sure
he
s
not
a
slave
he
agreed
He
s
one
of
the
Slavemasters
In
fact
Captain
Memory
furled
his
brow
in
thought
He
MIGHT
even
be
Waldo
Stadium
himself
So
what
are
we
doing
in
all
of
this
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Sterno
rolled
his
eyes
upward
Hopeless
Don
t
pick
on
the
kid
Captain
Memory
defended
Ernie
Yeah
Ernie
agreed
After
all
Captain
Memory
continued
It
s
not
his
fault
he
s
stupid
Yeah
it
s
Ernie
broke
off
That
wasn
t
turning
out
the
way
he
d
hoped
Sterno
looked
at
the
Captain
So
what
kind
of
super
hero
are
you
supposed
to
be
anyway
Me
Captain
Memory
expounded
Why
I
m
a
strange
visitor
from
another
planet
who
came
to
Earth
with
powers
and
abilities
far
beyond
those
of
mortal
men
Powers
and
abilities
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Like
what
Captain
Memory
continued
expansively
I
m
faster
than
a
speeding
bullet
more
powerful
than
a
locomotive
why
I
can
even
leap
tall
buildings
in
a
single
bound
This
was
beginning
to
sound
a
bit
familiar
to
Ernie
Anything
else
I
can
also
change
the
course
of
mighty
rivers
and
bend
steel
in
my
bare
hands
I
ve
got
it
now
thought
Ernie
You
don
t
by
any
chance
tend
to
go
around
disguised
as
Clark
Kent
mild
mannered
reporter
for
a
great
metropolitan
newspaper
and
fight
a
never
ending
battle
for
truth
justice
and
the
American
way
do
you
Captain
Memory
looked
totally
mystified
Why
no
Why
would
I
want
to
do
a
thing
like
that
Ernie
was
nonplussed
Well
I
dunno
I
just
sort
of
thought
He
trailed
off
There
was
an
awkward
silence
Sterno
cleared
his
throat
You
don
t
suppose
these
people
keep
caviar
about
somewhere
do
you
Grateful
for
the
interruption
Ernie
began
searching
He
found
a
small
white
cabinet
that
looked
like
it
might
be
a
refrigerator
Ah
He
pulled
out
a
small
jar
How
s
this
Sterno
examined
the
jar
ruefully
Oh
he
sniffed
American
caviar
Well
I
suppose
Beluga
was
a
bit
too
much
to
ask
We
ll
just
have
to
rough
it
I
imagine
He
looked
around
You
wouldn
t
happen
to
have
a
slice
of
fresh
onion
by
any
chance
Captain
Memory
had
returned
to
perusing
the
TV
Guide
