that
for
once
someone
agreed
with
him
Okay
well
that
proves
it
right
So
let
s
get
out
of
here
okay
I
ve
got
it
cried
Captain
Memory
He
grabbed
a
pen
and
wrote
in
large
childlike
block
letters
in
the
space
marked
Serial
Number
FROSTED
FLAKES
There
he
said
beaming
He
looked
at
the
next
line
and
his
face
fell
Oh
it
s
an
essay
question
I
hate
essay
questions
So
let
s
get
out
of
here
okay
Ernie
urged
He
felt
more
uneasy
with
each
passing
moment
Captain
Memory
sighed
I
guess
we
might
as
well
I
m
never
gonna
finish
this
thing
He
pushed
the
pile
of
papers
aside
Ernie
began
slowly
heading
toward
the
door
acutely
aware
of
all
the
clerks
watching
him
He
tried
to
act
as
nonchalant
as
possible
whistling
a
little
tune
and
shuffling
his
feet
as
he
walked
Just
a
minute
he
heard
the
old
woman
clerk
cry
out
Just
WHERE
do
you
think
you
re
going
Uh
uh
Ernie
stammered
Don
t
you
know
you
re
not
allowed
to
leave
without
filling
out
a
Form
Application
for
Authorization
to
Apply
for
Permission
for
an
Interruption
in
Completion
of
Forms
she
shrieked
Get
back
here
Ernie
thought
fast
Uh
I
gotta
go
to
the
bathroom
The
old
woman
glared
at
the
other
three
And
what
about
YOU
The
others
followed
Ernie
s
lead
Uh
we
all
gotta
go
to
the
bathroom
they
chorused
in
unison
The
clerk
scowled
All
right
Fill
out
this
Form
Request
for
Permission
to
Apply
for
Authorization
for
Admission
to
the
Sanitary
Facility
she
snapped
Anyway
you
re
going
the
wrong
way
The
bathroom
s
that
way
She
pointed
down
a
long
corridor
which
seemed
to
disappear
into
the
bowels
of
the
building
Ernie
looked
at
the
others
RUN
he
yelled
They
all
sprinted
for
the
door
Stop
them
shrieked
the
old
woman
but
they
were
already
through
the
door
Outside
they
found
themselves
on
the
dingy
streets
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
large
city
greatly
in
need
of
urban
renewal
We
d
better
keep
moving
Ernie
urged
They
re
right
behind
us
The
Fly
looked
back
No
they
re
not
Ernie
stopped
confused
and
turned
around
Sure
enough
there
was
no
sign
of
pursuit
Why
aren
t
they
chasing
us
Ernie
wondered
Oh
here
s
the
reason
said
Captain
Memory
regarding
his
bare
wrist
It
s
five
o
clock
Civil
servants
never
work
past
five
He
continued
to
regard
his
bare
wrist
I
d
really
like
to
get
a
watch
Ernie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
So
we
re
safe
then
At
least
till
nine
o
clock
tomorrow
morning
Captain
Memory
agreed
He
looked
around
brightly
Let
s
go
for
a
walk
Maybe
we
can
find
a
jewelry
store
somewhere
around
here
Captain
Memory
paused
reflectively
looking
at
his
bare
wrist
It
doesn
t
have
to
be
a
Rolex
A
Seiko
would
be
okay
Of
course
I
wouldn
t
mind
a
Rolex
They
began
strolling
down
the
street
As
they
neared
the
corner
they
began
to
hear
music
in
the
distance
Ernie
recognized
the
sound
of
steel
drums
and
guitars
Reggae
he
said
Somebody
s
playing
reggae
music
around
here
Ernie
relaxed
While
he
wasn
t
a
particular
fan
of
reggae
music
it
made
him
fell
more
at
home
to
come
across
anything
at
all
he
could
recognize
As
they
turned
the
corner
they
came
upon
a
group
of
black
people
who
seemed
to
be
having
a
party
They
wore
bright
colored
clothes
and
had
their
hair
hanging
down
in
long
braids
Dreadlocks
Ernie
recognized
They
must
be
Rastafarians
The
Fly
seemed
totally
confused
by
these
people
Hey
guy
he
said
to
one
of
them
Uh
do
you
live
around
here
Oh
no
mon
the
man
answered
in
a
thick
Jamaican
accent
We
not
from
here
mon
We
from
de
Islands
We
Rastas
In
spite
of
himself
Ernie
found
himself
becoming
suspicious
For
one
thing
they
didn
t
look
like
other
black
people
Ernie
knew
There
was
something
funny
about
their
skin
tone
It
was
unusually
black
and
it
seemed
to
be
coming
off
on
objects
around
them
Out
of
a
corner
of
his
eye
Ernie
noticed
a
trash
can
nearby
It
seemed
to
be
full
of
empty
bottles
of
black
shoe
polish
Another
of
the
Rastafarians
approached
the
Fly
Hey
brother
he
said
pointing
at
the
Fly
s
antenna
You
got
de
dreadlocks
too
I
see
Here
smoke
some
of
dis
ganja
He
handed
the
Fly
a
funny
looking
cigarette
Uh
thanks
The
Fly
accepted
the
cigarette
However
he
couldn
t
seem
to
fit
it
into
his
snout
no
matter
which
way
he
held
it
Ernie
heard
the
reassuring
strains
of
Bob
Marley
and
the
Wailers
drifting
out
through
a
nearby
doorway
but
he
was
unable
to
shake
his
suspicions
He
noticed
something
unusual
about
the
man
s
footwear
Since
when
do
Rastas
wear
jackboots
The
man
seemed
momentarily
nonplussed
but
quickly
recovered
his
composure
Oh
sure
mon
We
all
wear
de
jackboots
now
It
s
de
new
in
thing
He
turned
to
the
Fly
Ain
t
dat
right
brother
The
Fly
had
managed
to
get
a
grip
on
the
cigarette
with
his
snout
and
was
puffing
away
He
started
to
giggle
