for
only
one
short
scream
before
he
was
completely
engulfed
in
a
huge
flood
of
slick
paper
magazines
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
Poor
guy
he
should
have
read
the
fine
print
It
clearly
says
that
ordering
all
the
magazines
won
t
increase
your
chances
to
win
Tough
Ernie
said
callously
After
his
brush
with
the
pain
generator
he
wasn
t
in
the
mood
to
be
too
sympathetic
about
anything
that
happened
to
von
Liederkranz
So
why
don
t
we
get
out
of
here
okay
Hmm
said
Captain
Memory
thoughtfully
Out
of
here
you
say
Well
that
s
all
well
and
good
I
mean
anybody
can
just
say
let
s
get
out
of
here
but
He
trailed
off
Do
you
have
a
problem
with
that
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Well
um
said
Captain
Memory
thoughtfully
I
m
not
exacly
sure
where
we
should
go
next
My
last
location
didn
t
work
out
quite
the
way
I
intended
it
Hoow
about
the
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
Ernie
suggested
Maybe
we
should
go
and
check
them
out
Will
you
get
off
that
Dead
Sea
Phonograph
Records
business
Sterno
snapped
That
s
the
most
ridiculous
thing
I
ve
heard
in
in
He
thought
a
moment
two
billion
years
Well
have
you
got
a
better
idea
Ernie
said
exasperatedly
Loot
rape
and
pillage
said
the
Fly
thoughtfully
What
Ernie
didn
t
know
what
to
make
of
that
statement
at
all
You
know
the
Fly
continued
What
the
Nazi
was
saying
Loot
rape
and
pillage
It
reminds
me
of
something
but
I
can
t
quite
recall
what
The
Fly
concentrated
Doesn
t
it
just
drive
you
crazy
when
you
can
almost
think
of
something
and
then
just
when
you
think
you
got
it
it
gets
away
from
you
I
know
what
you
mean
said
Ernie
sympathetically
Let
me
see
now
said
Captain
Memory
reflectively
He
seemed
to
be
taking
the
Fly
s
problem
very
seriously
That
was
Rape
Loot
and
Pillage
Sterno
frowned
I
don
t
think
that
s
right
Captain
Memory
looked
surprised
What
s
wrong
with
it
It
s
not
a
song
title
is
it
No
Sterno
thought
a
moment
It
could
be
a
heavy
metal
rock
song
But
I
don
t
think
it
is
Captain
Memory
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
Well
that
s
one
less
thing
to
worry
about
He
fell
silent
he
seemed
to
be
lost
in
thought
Sterno
continued
I
think
it
s
supposed
to
be
loot
pillage
and
rape
The
Fly
considered
this
Loot
pillage
rape
not
loot
rape
pillage
How
about
pillage
rape
loot
Ernie
chimed
in
The
others
glared
at
him
Don
t
be
ridiculous
Sterno
snapped
Attila
the
Hun
the
Fly
cried
excitedly
What
Ernie
said
exasperatedly
What
in
the
world
does
that
have
to
do
with
anything
That
s
what
I
was
trying
to
think
of
The
Fly
was
jubilant
Boy
do
I
feel
better
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Hey
it
was
Attila
the
Hun
The
Captain
seemed
to
have
sunk
into
a
reverie
The
Fly
s
comment
seemed
to
suddenly
startle
him
out
of
it
What
Oh
Attila
the
Hun
Well
I
guess
I
can
t
think
of
anything
better
Ernie
didn
t
like
the
sound
of
this
Wait
a
minute
What
But
it
was
too
late
CE
Captain
Memory
cried
The
scene
vanished
CHAPTER
The
foursome
found
themselves
standing
on
a
grassy
hill
In
this
distance
a
column
of
smoke
rose
heavenward
from
a
village
that
was
being
pillaged
possibly
looted
and
raped
as
well
it
was
too
far
to
see
There
you
go
guys
said
Captain
Memory
cheerfully
Attila
the
Hun
Now
what
What
do
you
mean
Now
what
Ernie
demanded
If
you
don
t
know
what
we
re
going
to
do
here
then
why
did
you
bring
us
here
I
thought
you
wanted
to
come
here
Captain
Memory
protested
It
wasn
t
my
idea
I
was
just
trying
to
be
nice
Actually
I
thought
it
was
kind
of
a
weird
thing
to
do
I
mean
we
could
have
gone
to
Vegas
we
could
have
gone
to
Hawaii
but
no
you
want
to
go
see
Attila
the
Hun
Well
whose
idea
was
it
then
Ernie
wanted
to
know
Well
it
certainly
wasn
t
MY
idea
Sterno
demurred
They
all
looked
at
the
Fly
He
shifted
uncomfortably
Hey
I
was
just
making
conversation
you
know
I
didn
t
mean
we
should
actually
come
and
SEE
Attila
the
Hun
I
don
t
even
know
the
guy
you
know
Captain
Memory
chuckled
How
about
that
We
came
all
the
way
to
ancient
Rome
and
nobody
really
wanted
to
go
at
all
Funny
how
things
work
out
isn
t
it
Well
I
guess
we
ll
just
have
to
make
the
best
of
it
Ernie
looked
out
across
the
fields
How
can
we
be
in
anciant
Rome
anyway
he
asked
Educational
software
the
Captain
explained
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
WORLD
database
All
the
schools
have
it
Oh
Ernie
looked
down
He
noticed
they
were
standing
on
a
road
He
would
have
assumed
it
was
one
of
the
famous
Roman
Roads
except
that
it
was
made
of
yellow
brick
Ernie
was
almost
certain
that
the
Romans
didn
t
build
their
roads
out
of
yellow
bricks
but
he
decided
not
to
say
anything
