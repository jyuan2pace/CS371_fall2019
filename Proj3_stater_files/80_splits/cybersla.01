an
old
s
science
fiction
movie
Ernie
was
taken
aback
There
weren
t
supposed
to
be
any
flying
saucers
in
Goombah
the
Barbarian
The
flying
saucer
quickly
landed
a
few
yards
in
front
of
Ernie
and
two
space
creatures
emerged
They
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
humanoid
reptiles
They
reminded
Ernie
of
giant
iguanas
The
dog
under
Ernie
s
arm
wriggled
uncomfortably
Ernie
frowned
Space
creatures
he
thought
What
am
I
supposed
to
do
with
space
creatures
This
isn
t
what
I
was
expecting
at
all
Ernie
frowned
What
kind
of
game
is
this
anyway
The
creatures
began
approaching
Ernie
Maybe
I
m
supposed
to
say
something
he
considered
Suddenly
an
idea
occurred
to
him
He
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
Klaatu
barada
nikto
he
announced
One
of
the
space
creatures
pulled
out
a
ray
gun
and
pointed
it
at
him
Hmm
thought
Ernie
Maybe
that
wasn
t
quite
the
right
thing
to
say
It
occurred
to
Ernie
that
a
strategic
retreat
might
be
a
good
idea
He
looked
around
quickly
Unfortunately
the
landscape
of
swirling
mists
and
forbidding
hills
didn
t
seem
to
contain
anyplace
to
retreat
to
Ernie
turned
back
to
the
creatures
Look
uh
what
I
said
about
Klaatu
I
didn
t
really
mean
The
creature
fired
Ernie
felt
himself
suddenly
stiffen
into
immobility
It
s
stunned
sir
Ernie
heard
one
creature
say
to
the
other
Good
load
it
onto
the
ship
The
two
creatures
lifted
Ernie
who
had
become
stiff
as
a
board
and
began
carrying
him
dog
and
all
toward
the
ship
In
spite
of
himself
Ernie
was
impressed
These
special
effects
are
fantastic
he
thought
I
wonder
how
they
do
that
Stunner
business
Suddenly
a
costumed
comic
book
character
appeared
complete
with
flowing
cape
and
a
big
red
M
on
his
chest
He
blocked
the
aliens
path
Unhand
that
barbarian
the
comic
book
character
boomed
The
space
creature
looked
at
each
other
in
confusion
Unhand
What
does
that
mean
Are
we
supposed
to
cut
off
his
hands
The
comic
book
character
looked
exasperated
Look
just
put
him
down
okay
he
said
in
a
much
more
conversational
tone
Put
him
down
Put
him
down
One
space
creature
looked
at
the
other
What
do
we
do
now
sir
Oh
I
don
t
know
the
other
creature
replied
Just
disintegrate
him
I
guess
They
drew
their
weapons
The
comic
book
character
looked
confused
Um
uh
The
creatures
advanced
menacingly
Suddenly
the
comic
book
character
shouted
what
seemed
to
Ernie
to
be
a
very
odd
thing
JMP
F
Instantly
the
entire
scene
vanished
Ernie
still
stiff
and
board
like
found
himself
unsupported
and
dropped
three
feet
to
land
with
a
thud
on
a
carpeted
floor
Hi
guy
Ernie
heard
someone
say
Howya
doin
Ernie
attempted
to
moan
but
discovered
that
he
was
still
quite
securely
frozen
Here
let
me
help
you
up
he
heard
the
same
voice
say
The
room
swung
into
view
as
he
felt
himself
lifted
up
and
placed
on
his
feet
like
a
statue
He
seemed
to
be
in
someone
s
living
room
The
owner
of
the
voice
came
into
view
It
was
the
comic
book
character
who
in
the
cold
light
of
day
appeared
to
be
a
pleasant
although
rather
vacuous
looking
fellow
of
indeterminate
age
Allow
me
to
introduce
myself
he
said
cheerfully
I
m
Captain
Memory
He
extended
a
hand
Ernie
instinctively
attempted
to
shake
the
man
s
hand
but
discovered
he
was
still
quite
frozen
It
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
still
carrying
the
silly
little
dog
which
was
also
frozen
The
man
dropped
his
outstretched
hand
embarrassedly
Hey
I
forgot
he
said
cheerfully
You
re
still
paralyzed
Hey
no
sweat
It
ll
wear
off
in
a
few
minutes
The
man
seated
himself
on
a
nearby
sofa
and
began
perusing
a
small
book
he
had
produced
from
somewhere
Ernie
of
course
continued
to
stand
where
he
was
immobilized
This
is
a
really
weird
game
Ernie
thought
The
special
effects
are
fantastic
but
the
story
line
is
bizarre
Like
what
am
I
supposed
to
do
now
After
about
fifteen
minutes
Ernie
s
little
finger
began
to
twitch
The
twitching
slowly
spread
across
his
hand
Finally
with
great
effort
Ernie
was
able
to
take
a
step
towards
the
comic
book
character
who
was
still
seated
on
the
sofa
reading
his
book
The
comic
book
character
looked
up
Ah
it
s
wearing
off
he
said
Are
you
feeling
okay
Ungph
said
Ernie
discovering
that
the
power
of
speech
was
slowly
returning
to
him
Captain
Memory
took
that
to
mean
yes
Good
good
he
replied
in
a
cheerful
tone
Wharf
gumg
om
Ernie
got
out
with
difficulty
You
re
probably
wondering
what
s
going
on
Yarf
Ernie
felt
something
sharp
digging
into
his
side
It
was
the
little
dog
trying
to
get
away
Unfortunately
that
arm
had
not
unfrozen
yet
Ernie
s
ability
to
speak
seemed
to
have
returned
All
right
so
what
IS
going
on
I
had
to
rescue
you
from
those
creatures
Captain
Memory
explained
They
were
taking
you
to
be
a
Cyberslave
in
the
mining
pits
Ernie
frowned
What
s
a
Cyberslave
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
They
were
going
to
force
you
to
operate
mining
robots
like
so
many
other
poor
fools
before
