the
distance
What

Ernie
wanted
to
know
Fireflies
Torches
the
Fly
corrected
It
s
those
villagers
we
saw
in
the
mountains
They
ve
come
to
meet
us
Isn
t
that
nice
Ernie
was
still
uneasy
Are
you
sure
they
re
friendly
villagers
The
Fly
peered
into
the
distance
They
sure
LOOK
friendly
It
looks
like
they
re
having
a
party
They
re
all
singing
and
dancing
As
the
villagers
approached
Ernie
began
to
be
able
to
make
out
what
they
were
singing
They
were
chanting
rhythmically
to
the
beat
of
the
drums
Na
na
na
na
na
na
na
na
na
Ernie
frowned
I
KNOW
that
song
It
s
um

s
Sure
the
Fly
broke
in
Land
of
Dances
What
a
great
song
AHA
cried
Ernie
See
I
told
you
I
was
right
He
turned
to
Sterno
See
This
is
The
Land
of
Dances
I
was
right
after
all
You

not
sniffed
Sterno
That
was

Land

Ernie
sulked
Well

was
sort
of
right
Anyway

The
Land
of
Dances
so

guys
with
the
torches

He
suddenly
turned
pale
CANNIBAL
AND
THE
HEADHUNTERS
Cool
agreed
the
Fly
Great
band
huh
What
are
we
gonna
DO
wailed
Ernie
Suddenly
they
were
distracted
by
a
loud
crashing
in
the
forest
behind
them
Gottverdammter
Schweinhund
The
crack
of
a
riding
crop
could
clearly
be
heard
They
turned
to
see
bright
fingers
of
white
light
as
though
from
high
powered
flashlights
probing
through
the
foliage
Zey
must
be
in
here
somevhere
they
heard
a
voice
call
out
Ze
trail
of
isotope
tracers
from
ze
radioactive
lamb
chops
leads
right
zis
vay
Ernie
pressed
his
hands
to
his
stomach
I
don
t
feel
good
he
moaned
Ernie
looked
up
to
find
the
other
three
glaring
at
him
How
was
I
to
know
the
lamb
chops
were
radioactive
he
protested
loudly
Do
you
think
I
would
have
eaten
them
if
I
knew
Ssh
The
four
heard
the
voice
behind
them
call
out
I
tink
I
hear
zem
Ernie
quickly
put
a
hand
over
his
mouth
Up
ahead
the
bobbing
torchlights
were
weaving
ever
closer
The
pounding
drums
and
chanting
was
getting
louder
The
chanting
had
changed
now
Oom
alla
Boom
Ernie
could
hear
Oom
alla
BOOM
From
behind
the
searchlights
were
weaving
ever
more
in
their
direction
slowly
beginning
to
focus
in
on
their
position
Ernie
whimpered
quietly
Hey
guys
look
at
this
the
Fly
pointed
to
something
in
the
darkness
Off
to
the
right
visible
only
to
the
Fly
s
huge
insect
eyes
a
faint
trail
split
off
from
the
main
path
Let
s
try
this
The
Fly
hurried
down
the
trail
The
others
followed
as
closely
as
possible
so
as
not
to
get
lost
in
the
increasing
darkness
The
four
scampered
along
the
dark
narrow
path
attempting
to
move
quickly
but
also
quietly
and
not
doing
a
very
good
job
of
either
The
sounds
of
pursuit
behind
them
seem
to
grow
ever
louder
The
trail
led
to
a
large
clearing
and
then
stopped
Surrounding
the
clearing
was
an
impenetrable
thicket
of
thorn
bushes
In
the
middle
of
the
clearing
was
a
large
iron
pot
big
enough
for
all
four
of
them
to
fit
into
at
the
same
time
It
sat
on
a
large
pile
of
neatly
arranged
firewood
A
heap
of
neatly
cut
up
potatoes
and
carrots
lay
nearby
I
don
t
like
the
looks
of
this
Ernie
moaned
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Can
t
you
get
us
out
of
here
he
pleaded
Captain
Memory
frowned
He
seemed
lost
in
thought
Well
I
suppose
it
s
worth
a
try
he
said
dubiously
With
that
he
turned
suddenly
and
slugged
Ernie
in
the
stomach
hard
Oof
Ernie
doubled
over
in
pain
Hey
what
BEEP
BEEP
BEEP
Ernie
was
astounded
at
the
sounds
coming
out
of
his
mouth
Good
Captain
Memory
cheered
It
still
works
Ernie
coughed
What
what
still
works
The
remote
Captain
Memory
seemed
particularly
cheerful
I
just
remembered
that
a
Franglian
remote
will
still
work
even
if
you
eat
it
Quality
construction
you
know
He
nodded
wisely
I
paid
a
little
extra
but
it
was
worth
it
The
Captain
regarded
Ernie
carefully
The
only
problem
is
it
s
a
little
hard
to
press
the
buttons
Let
me
see
Without
warning
he
elbowed
Ernie
violently
in
the
kidneys
Ernie
fell
to
the
ground
in
pain
He
opened
his
mouth
BEEP
BOOP
Captain
Memory
looked
embarrassed
Oh
sorry
Wrong
button
The
toe
of
his
boot
slammed
into
Ernie
s
ribs
BOOP
BEEP
There
we
go
Captain
Memory
exulted
Now
we
ve
got
it
Ernie
lay
in
the
dirt
moaning
Captain
Memory
reached
down
to
help
him
to
his
feet
Sorry
about
that
he
apologized
Still
you
have
to
expect
that
sort
of
thing
if
you
re
going
to
go
around
eating
remote
control
units
Ernie
staggered
to
his
feet
moaning
Look
the
Fly
pointed
up
into
the
sky
A
bright
object
seemed
to
be
descending
in
their
direction
Captain
Memory
looked
at
his
bare
wrist
Ah
here
he
comes
Right
on
time
The
Captain
looked
at
his
wrist
more
closely
Well
almost
on
time
As
the
bright
object
approached
Ernie
began
