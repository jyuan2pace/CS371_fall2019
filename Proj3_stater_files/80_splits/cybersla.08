In
fact
I
happen
to
have
some
with
me
Perhaps
you
d
like
to
see
it
Mmm
Captain
Memory
was
gazing
at
the
view
Sterno
took
his
answer
to
be
a
yes
and
handed
him
a
piece
of
paper
with
some
verses
on
it
Captain
Memory
barely
glanced
at
it
Looks
like
doggerel
to
me
he
said
uncaringly
Sterno
s
mood
turned
black
I
suppose
you
think
that
s
funny
he
snarled
I
open
my
heart
to
you
and
you
mock
me
Well
we
ll
see
who
has
the
last
laugh
I
know
when
I
m
right
I
m
right
and
you
re
wrong
and
that
s
all
there
is
to
it
Ernie
thought
a
moment
Sounds
to
me
like
you
re
being
a
bit
dogmatic
to
me
You
fool
Sterno
barked
You
don
t
even
have
the
vaguest
idea
what
s
going
on
here
You
re
a
fine
one
to
talk
Captain
Memory
abruptly
changed
the
subject
Wanna
watch
some
TV
Ernie
really
didn
t
want
to
watch
any
TV
but
he
was
feeling
very
uncomfortable
with
the
current
drift
of
the
conversation
Maybe
watching
TV
would
be
a
good
way
to
change
the
subject
Uh
this
isn
t
gonna
be
like
last
time
is
it
We
re
not
going
to
get
sucked
into
the
TV
show
again
are
we
Naw
the
Captain
assured
him
That
was
a
fluke
One
in
a
million
chance
It
ll
never
happen
again
Well
okay
then
Ernie
agreed
reluctantly
Captain
Memory
returned
to
the
harpsichord
Um
F
sharp
He
hit
the
appropriate
keys
The
ceiling
view
screen
suddenly
changed
from
a
view
of
space
to
a
television
picture
They
seemed
to
have
tuned
in
to
a
commercial
The
announcer
was
an
dour
looking
man
wearing
a
brown
military
uniform
and
jackboots
He
seemed
to
be
making
a
strenuous
effort
to
be
cheerful
Hi
I
m
Martin
Bohrmann
the
announcer
held
up
two
record
albums
And
if
you
remember
me
you
remember
HITLER
S
GREATEST
HITS
I
don
t
remember
that
said
Ernie
to
no
one
in
particular
Now
together
at
last
on
these
two
long
playing
record
albums
all
time
golden
hits
from
the
Third
Reich
You
get
the
Gestapo
Glee
Club
with
HEIL
HITLER
DEAR
Military
sounding
music
started
up
in
the
background
Do
we
have
to
watch
this
Ernie
complained
you
can
t
buy
these
records
in
any
store
but
if
you
call
this
number
a
secret
messenger
will
knock
on
your
door
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
Oh
okay
I
ll
change
it
Captain
Memory
struck
a
key
on
the
harpsichord
The
screen
changed
to
black
and
white
Characters
in
s
clothing
appeared
It
s
an
old
movie
Ernie
commented
He
felt
better
An
old
movie
that
would
be
safe
right
Nothing
bad
could
happen
out
of
an
old
movie
right
A
man
in
a
suit
with
a
cloth
over
his
head
appeared
on
the
screen
A
pretty
young
woman
came
up
to
him
and
suddenly
yanked
the
cloth
away
Under
the
cloth
the
man
had
the
tremendously
enlarged
head
of
a
fly
complete
with
huge
multifaceted
eyes
antennae
and
a
long
black
snout
The
young
woman
began
to
scream
Hey
I
remember
this
said
Ernie
brightly
It
s
THE
FLY
the
original
version
too
You
know
that
movie
about
the
scientist
who
goes
into
a
matter
transmitter
except
a
fly
gets
in
it
and
he
winds
up
with
the
head
of
a
fly
Hey
this
is
a
great
movie
Ernie
settled
back
to
watch
pleased
that
he
could
finally
watch
something
he
understood
The
movie
cut
to
a
commercial
Hi
I
m
Martin
Bohrmann
and
if
you
remember
me
Ernie
moaned
I
wish
they
wouldn
t
keep
running
the
same
commercial
he
thought
The
commercial
ended
And
now
back
to
THE
DATING
GAME
THE
DATING
GAME
Ernie
sat
bolt
upright
I
don
t
wanna
watch
the
Dating
Game
What
happened
to
my
movie
Captain
Memory
looked
up
Oh
a
game
show
he
said
brightly
He
hadn
t
been
paying
much
attention
up
to
this
point
I
like
game
shows
You
know
you
can
really
get
into
game
shows
I
KNOW
Ernie
interrupted
That
s
what
I
m
AFRAID
of
The
man
on
the
screen
looked
like
a
typical
game
show
host
wearing
a
plaid
polyester
suit
with
a
large
carnation
in
his
lapel
The
only
thing
that
seemed
a
bit
odd
about
him
is
that
he
was
wearing
jackboots
and
a
monocle
Congratulations
he
was
saying
to
an
excited
female
contestant
You
fe
von
an
all
expenses
paid
dream
date
vit
bachelor
number
The
game
show
host
seemed
to
have
a
bit
of
a
German
accent
Oh
I
just
can
t
wait
to
see
him
The
young
woman
was
jumping
up
and
down
with
excitement
Bachelor
number
three
come
on
out
The
game
show
host
called
out
A
door
opened
and
out
stepped
a
man
wearing
a
suit
who
had
the
enormously
enlarged
head
of
a
fly
The
young
woman
began
to
scream
Ernie
looked
confused
Hey
what
are
we
watching
anyway
Is
this
THE
FLY
or
THE
DATING
GAME
or
what
Captain
Memory
was
looking
at
the
TV
Guide
upside
down
Mmm
hmm
he
agreed
not
paying
much
attention
The
host
seemed
to
