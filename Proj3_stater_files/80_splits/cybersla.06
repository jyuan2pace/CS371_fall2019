their
noses
now
Light
seemed
to
be
appearing
behind
their
eyes
A
silver
watch
might
be
nice
Do
you
think
silver
would
look
good
with
this
outfit
Captain
Memory
wondered
I
really
REALLY
think
we
ought
to
do
something
said
Ernie
urgently
The
TV
addicts
bodies
were
beginning
to
swell
rapidly
Ernie
inched
away
from
them
Oh
well
said
Captain
Memory
unhurriedly
I
guess
it
s
time
to
go
Uh
let
s
see
He
thought
a
moment
Let
s
try
PUSH
FF
C
With
that
they
were
gone
Ernie
blinked
and
staggered
The
scene
had
changed
completely
Now
he
saw
an
elaborate
th
century
drawing
room
around
him
The
walls
were
decorated
with
filigreed
mirrors
and
candelabras
Delicate
furniture
surrounded
them
It
all
looked
very
expensive
Captain
Memory
looked
about
obviously
pleased
with
himself
Hey
it
worked
Ernie
s
head
swam
He
felt
confused
and
disoriented
These
abrupt
changes
of
scene
were
making
him
sick
He
sagged
into
a
chair
I
don
t
feel
very
good
he
complained
Sterno
puffed
his
cigar
This
is
almost
decent
he
mused
You
don
t
suppose
there
s
a
snifter
of
brandy
about
do
you
The
sound
of
a
harpsichord
drifted
in
from
somewhere
Ah
Telemann
Sterno
commented
Very
tasteful
Captain
Memory
turned
to
Ernie
Gee
I
m
sorry
you
re
not
feeling
well
he
commiserated
Would
it
make
you
feel
better
to
watch
some
TV
Ernie
sat
bolt
upright
NO
The
Captain
had
brought
along
his
copy
of
TV
Guide
You
re
missing
the
Ozzie
and
Hitler
Show
I
don
t
care
This
is
a
good
episode
Ozzie
forgets
that
the
boss
is
coming
for
dinner
so
Hitler
has
to
invade
Poland
on
a
moment
s
notice
Captain
Memory
chuckled
I
don
t
like
these
TV
programs
grumbled
Ernie
Well
you
know
said
Captain
Memory
conversationally
If
you
re
going
to
travel
to
other
Realities
you
re
not
always
going
to
be
able
to
get
your
favorite
TV
shows
I
want
to
go
home
Ernie
sulked
Suddenly
a
thought
occurred
to
him
He
brightened
Hey
this
is
really
just
a
game
right
Sterno
glared
at
him
This
game
business
is
getting
really
old
Knock
it
off
okay
Ernie
had
begun
methodically
feeling
the
furniture
He
reasoned
that
if
it
were
a
Virtual
Reality
illusion
he
would
be
able
to
see
it
but
since
it
had
no
substance
he
wouldn
t
be
able
to
feel
it
If
my
hand
goes
right
through
this
stuff
he
figured
I
ll
know
it
s
just
an
illusion
Unfortunately
everything
was
proving
to
be
distressingly
solid
You
know
you
look
really
stupid
in
that
fur
loincloth
Sterno
commented
And
what
in
the
world
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
ridiculous
plastic
broadsword
Well
I
hadda
put
a
deposit
on
it
said
Ernie
defensively
If
I
don
t
bring
it
back
I
lose
bucks
Sterno
shook
his
head
He
turned
to
Captain
Memory
Do
we
really
have
to
drag
this
kid
around
with
us
Captain
Memory
shook
his
head
sadly
I
m
afraid
so
Why
Sterno
demanded
Well
you
know
the
Captain
said
off
handedly
We
can
t
just
leave
him
to
be
a
Cyberslave
It
wouldn
t
be
you
know
nice
A
thought
occurred
to
Ernie
So
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
all
of
this
anyway
Hmm
Captain
Memory
still
perusing
the
TV
Guide
was
not
paying
very
much
attention
Like
are
we
just
going
to
keep
bopping
around
Cyberspace
or
what
I
mean
do
you
have
a
Plan
or
something
Captain
Memory
pulled
himself
up
Of
course
I
have
a
Plan
He
turned
to
Sterno
See
I
have
Powers
and
I
have
a
Plan
Okay
okay
Sterno
agreed
wearily
You
re
a
fine
super
hero
So
what
s
the
plan
We
have
to
find
a
way
to
terminate
this
reality
within
the
confines
of
it
s
own
logic
the
Captain
explained
Huh
Ernie
didn
t
follow
this
We
have
to
end
the
game
the
Captain
rephrased
We
have
to
carry
it
through
to
it
s
logical
conclusion
so
that
it
terminates
and
shuts
down
Ernie
frowned
What
s
the
point
of
this
game
anyway
That
s
a
problem
the
Captain
admitted
This
isn
t
a
game
It
s
dozens
maybe
hundreds
of
games
all
stuck
together
in
no
order
The
point
of
what
we
re
in
now
could
be
the
point
of
any
of
the
games
or
all
of
them
or
none
of
them
There
s
no
way
to
tell
Luckily
we
don
t
have
to
win
the
game
we
just
have
to
end
it
Any
ending
that
s
logically
consistent
will
do
Sterno
frowned
Why
do
you
have
to
end
it
within
it
s
own
logic
system
Couldn
t
you
just
crash
it
Captain
Memory
sighed
I
could
crash
the
system
but
it
wouldn
t
be
a
good
idea
Why
not
Sterno
demanded
Why
can
t
you
just
insert
some
totally
impossible
instruction
and
crash
out
the
whole
system
Then
this
whole
thing
would
be
over
and
we
could
get
out
of
here
That
s
true
the
Captain
admitted
but
you
d
get
some
bad
um
side
effects
Like
what
Sterno
wanted
to
know
You
see
Captain
Memory
explained
After
you
ve
been
in
Cyberspace
for
a
while
you
brain
